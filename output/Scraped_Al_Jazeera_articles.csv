The new text - the third now before the council on investigating the apparent gas attack - was presented ahead of a closed-door meeting of the 15-member council on Syria on Thursday evening.

The US, UK and France proposed a first draft resolution on Tuesday to condemn the attack and press Syria to cooperate with international investigators.

Russia said the text was unacceptable and proposed a rival draft that does not include specific demands that the Syrian government cooperate with an investigation.

The draft by the non-permanent members is based on the first one, but drops demands that Syria hand over information on its military operations on the day of the strike, replacing them with language from a previous resolution urging cooperation on chemical weapons investigations, diplomats said.

It remained unclear if Russia or the other four permanent council members would back the compromise presented as the United States was weighing military options in Syria.

""UN Security Council will no longer vote on the [resolution] on Syria this evening. Consultations among council members are ongoing,"" British diplomat Stephen Hickey posted on Twitter.

At least 86 people - including 27 children - died in the rebel-held town of Khan Sheikhoun in Idlib province on Tuesday, according to the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.

Results from post-mortems performed on victims point to exposure to the deadly sarin nerve agent, according to Turkish health officials.

Britain, France and the United States are permanent council members along with Russia and China.

The 10 non-permanent members are Egypt, Japan, Senegal, Ukraine, Uruguay, Bolivia, Ethiopia, Italy, Kazakhstan and Sweden.

""There are efforts to find a way forward that might be a compromise,"" Swedish Ambassador Olof Skoog told reporters.

""We are going to try to make sure we have a good discussion before there are any votes.""



Russia has rejected the proposed Western-backed resolution as ""categorically unacceptable"".

The Russian text calls for an investigation but requests that the council approve the makeup of the team from the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) dispatched to Idlib, according to the draft seen by AFP.

In February, Syrian ally Russia, backed by China, cast its seventh veto to protect Bashar al-Assad's government from council action, blocking a bid by Western powers to impose sanctions over accusations of chemical weapons attacks. China has vetoed six resolutions on Syria.

A Security Council resolution needs nine votes in favour and no vetoes by the United States, Britain, France, Russia or China to pass.

China's UN Ambassador Liu Jieyi said on Thursday he hopes the Security Council can reach consensus on a resolution condemning the reported use of chemical weapons."

""I think what happened in Syria is a disgrace to humanity and he's there, and I guess he's running things, so something should happen,"" Trump told reporters on Air Force One, en route to meet China's President Xi Jinping at a Florida summit on Thursday.

While Trump stopped short of calling on Assad to leave office, the comments were his strongest suggestion yet that the United States may be edging towards a stronger stance against Assad.

His stance was underlined by Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who told reporters: ""There's no role for [Assad] to govern the Syrian people"".

Tillerson, who spoke almost simultaneously after greeting Xi in West Palm Beach, said the US was evaluating an appropriate response.

""The process by which Assad would leave is something that will require an international community effort,"" Tillerson said, adding there needs to be a balance between defeating the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) and stabilising Syria to prevent the war from escalating.

Tillerson also issued a warning to Russia, a key ally of Damascus, that its support of the Assad government is something it should ""consider carefully"".

The poison gas attack on the rebel-held town of Khan Sheikhoun in Idlib province killed at least 86 people, including 27 children, according to the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.

Turkey said samples from victims of Tuesday's attack indicate they were exposed to sarin, a highly toxic nerve agent.

The World Health Organization and Doctors Without Borders also reported that victims from the attack showed symptoms consistent with the use of a nerve agent such as sarin.

The Syrian government rejected the accusations, and Moscow warned against apportioning blame until an investigation has been carried out.

Trump has until now focused his Syria policy almost exclusively on defeating ISIL in northern Syria, where US special forces are working with Arab and Kurdish armed groups.

Only last week, the US Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley said the US diplomatic policy on Syria was no longer focused on forcing Assad to leave power.

But Trump said on Wednesday the gas attack had caused him to reconsider his opinion of Assad, adding it crossed ""many, many lines"" - not just the ""red line"" of chemical weapons use that former president Barack Obama once set as an ultimatum for the Assad government.

An anonymous US official told Reuters news agency on Thursday that options being discussed by the Pentagon and White House could include grounding aircraft used by Assad's forces.

Others could include the use of cruise missiles, allowing the US to strike targets without putting piloted aircraft in the skies above Syria.

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on Thursday he hoped Trump would take military action, Turkey's state-run Anadolu Agency reported.

Erdogan said Turkey would be prepared to do ""whatever falls on us"" to support possible military action.

Jessica Ashooh, the deputy director of the Middle East Strategy Task Force at the Atlantic Council, a foreign policy think-tank in Washington DC, said every president is tested early on and it appears that Syria has become the test for Trump and his administration.

""What he does in this situation is going to colour how the world views his presidency and it's going to influence what countries like Russia or North Korea believe they can or cannot get away with,"" she told Al Jazeera.

If confirmed, the chemical attack will be the deadliest since sarin gas killed hundreds of civilians in Ghouta near the capital, Damascus, in August 2013.

Western states said the Syrian government was responsible for the 2013 attack. Damascus blamed rebels."

Thirty-two victims of Tuesday's attack were brought to Turkey where three subsequently died.

""Autopsies were carried out on three of the bodies after they were brought from Idlib. The results of the autopsy confirms that chemical weapons were used,"" Justice Minister Bekir Bozdag said, quoted by state-run Anadolu news agency.

""This scientific investigation also confirms that Assad used chemical weapons,"" Bozdag added, without giving further details.

Syria attack victims treated in Turkey

The attack on the town of Khan Sheikhoun drew widespread international condemnation and public revulsion, prompting the United Nations to pledge it would investigate it as a possible war crime.

The Syrian govenment denied carrying out the raid. Russia, a key military ally of the Bashar al-Assad government, has blamed the opposition, saying a government shell hit a building where rebels were producing chemical weapons. The rebels deny this.

On Thursday, Russian President Vladimir Putin told Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu by phone that it was ""unacceptable to make groundless accusations against anyone without conducting a detailed and unbiased investigation"", according to a statement issued by the Kremlin.

Syria's Foreign Minister Walid al-Moallem called the accusations in a press conference on Thursday an unjust campaign against Syria.

""The campaign (chemical attack) was launched at 6:00 in the morning while the first air raid carried out by Syrian jet fighters was at 11.30 in the morning. It was targeting a weapons and ammunitions depot belonging to al-Nusra Front which happened to contain chemical weapons,"" Moallem said.

The World Health Organization has also said some survivors had symptoms consistent with exposure to a category of chemicals that includes nerve agents.

The Syrian American Medical Society (SAMS), which runs several field hospitals in Idlib, said doctors on the ground said the attack caused people to vomit and foam at the mouth. Others lost consciousness and suffered muscle spasms.

The group said the symptoms, which also included constricted pupils and slow heart rates, were indicative of an organo-phosphorus compounds agent.

The apparent chemical attack is the deadliest such incident since sarin gas killed hundreds of civilians in Ghouta near the capital in August 2013.

Assault goes on

The government assault on Idlib province has continued, a monitoring group said on Thursday, with air raids killing at least 27 people - including 13 children - in the rebel-held town of Salqin on Wednesday.

Air raids also targeted Jisr al-Shughour, a northern town in Idlib province, killing at least two people and wounding six others, the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said.

Elsewhere in Syria, the Observatory said government air raids killed at least 18 people, including nine children, in Saqba city in the Damascus suburbs on Wednesday.

In other parts of the suburbs, ten people were killed on Wednesday in air raids that targeted Douma, Hamouriah and Jesrin in Eastern Ghouta."

At least 86 people were killed and hundreds - including people foaming at the mouth - were hospitalised after Tuesday's chemical incident on the town of Khan Sheikhoun, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based monitoring group.

The deaths, blamed by many on the government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, prompted the United Nations to pledge it would investigate the incident as a possible war crime.

But Walid Muallem, Syria's foreign minister, on Thursday denied the charges, calling them an unjust campaign against Syria launched by countries known for their hostility.

""I stress to you once again: the Syrian army has not, did not, and will not use this kind of weapons - not just against our own people, but even against the terrorists that are targeting our civilians indiscriminately,"" he said at a press conference in Damascus.

Muallem said the Syrian army had bombed a warehouse belonging to rebels that contained chemical weapons, echoing earlier comments made by Russia, a key ally of the Assad government. The rebels deny this.

""The first air raid conducted by the Syrian army was at 1130am (0830:GMT) on that day [Tuesday] and it attacked an arms depot belonging to al-Nusra Front [al-Qaeda's former Syria affiliate] chemical weapons,"" he said.

Responding to calls for an international investigation, Muallem said the Syrian government needed guarantees that any fact-finding mission into Idlib's attack would be impartial and not ""politicised"".

The foreign minister said Syria's experience with past missions is ""not encouraging"", adding that Damascus would only consider the idea of an inquiry if its concerns were addressed.

""He said that he believes that results will be changed, even if they allow full access to any international investigators,"" Al Jazeera's Alan Fisher, reporting from Beirut, said.

At least 32 people were transferred across the border into Turkey for treatment, and Ankara said autopsies performed on three people who died in Turkish hospitals confirmed chemical weapons had been used.

""Autopsies were carried out on three of the bodies after they were brought from Idlib. The results of the autopsy confirms that chemical weapons were used,"" Bekir Bozdag, Turkey's justice minister, said on Thursday, according to state-run Anadolu news agency.

""This scientific investigation also confirms that Assad used chemical weapons,"" Bozdag added, without giving further details.

Western states said the Syrian government was responsible for the 2013 attack. Damascus blamed rebels."

""When the United Nations consistently fails in its duty to act collectively, there are times in the life of states that we are compelled to take our own action,"" US Ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley said on Wednesday.

The warning came during an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council called by France and Britain after an early morning attack on Tuesday in Khan Sheikhoun in Idlib province.

Britain, France and the US presented a draft resolution demanding a full investigation of the attack, which they blamed on the Syrian government.

But talks ended without a vote after Russia, an ally of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, said the text was ""categorically unacceptable"".

Syria has denied the allegations, while Russia had blamed the rebels, saying the deaths occurred when a government shell hit a rebel chemical weapons depot.

'Horrific acts'

Haley lashed out at Moscow for failing to rein in Damascus, standing in the council chamber to hold up photographs of victims - one showing a young child lying lifeless, a mask covering his face.

""How many more children have to die before Russia cares?"" she asked.

""If Russia has the influence in Syria that it claims to have, we need to see them use it,"" she said. ""We need to see them put an end to these horrific acts.""

The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitoring group said at least 86 people, including 30 children, were killed in the raid on Khan Sheikhoun.

Dozens more were left gasping for air, convulsing, and foaming at the mouth, doctors said.

If confirmed, it will be be the worst chemical weapons attack in Syria since 2013, when sarin gas was used on a rebel-held area of Damascus.

""If we are not prepared to act, then this council will keep meeting, month after month to express outrage at the continuing use of chemical weapons and it will not end,"" Haley said.

""We will see more conflict in Syria. We will see more pictures that we can never unsee.""

READ MORE: 'Chemical attack' in Syria draws international outrage

The draft resolution backs a probe by the Organisation of the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) and demands that Syria cooperate to provide information on its military operations on the day of the assault.

Russia's Deputy Ambassador Vladimir Safronkov told the council the proposed measure was hastily prepared and unnecessary, but voiced support for an investigation.

""The main task now is to have an objective inquiry into what happened,"" he said.

Negotiations continued on the proposed resolutions throughout most of Wednesday. Diplomats said it could come up for a vote at the council as early as Thursday.

'Many, many lines' crossed

In a press conference at the White House later in the day, US President Donald Trump said the chemical attack had crossed ""many, many lines"" and had abruptly changed his thinking about Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.

Only days earlier multiple members of Trump's administration had said Assad's ouster was no longer a US priority, drawing outrage from Assad critics in the United States and abroad. But Trump said Tuesday's attack ""had a big impact on me - big impact"".

""My attitude towards Syria and Assad has changed very much,"" he said, but refused to telegraph any potential US military retaliation.

Since the attack, Trump has been under increasing pressure to explain whether it was egregious enough to force a US response.

Robert Ford, former US ambassador to Syria, expressed scepticism that Trump would resort to military action.

""As a presidential candidate he could not have been more clear that he wanted to avoid military involvement in the Syrian civil war,"" he told Al Jazeera. ""For him to order military strikes, even limited military strikes, in response to the chemical attack in Idlib, would be a gigantic change and not one that I'm at all sure that the administration is actually going to do.""

Ford said all fingers point to the Syrian government as the culprit of the attack.

""I find it laughable that governments such as Russia would suggest that rebels have a chemical weapons capacity but they always seem to use it on their own people and never on the Syrian army,"" he added.

Idlib hospitals overwhelmed after suspected gas attack

Trump's first reaction to the attack was to blame former president Barack Obama's ""weakness"" in earlier years for enabling Assad.

Obama had put Assad on notice that using chemical weapons would cross a ""red line"" necessitating a US response, but then failed to follow through, pulling back from planned air strikes on Assad's forces after Congress would not vote to approve them.

Trump and other critics have cited that as a key moment the US lost much global credibility.

""I now have responsibility,"" Trump said. ""That responsibility could be made a lot easier if it was handled years ago.""

Joshua Landis, director for the Centre of Middle East Studies at the University of Oklahoma, told Al Jazeera that the US would likely warn Moscow if it was to resort to using military might in Syria.

""They have to disambiguate and they have to make sure that they don’t hurt any Russian soldiers,"" he said.

""But there’s a wide palette of things they can do. They can bomb airports and destroy the runways so that Syrian planes can’t fly for some time, they could kill a bunch of Syrian soldiers, they could destroy command centres…we'll have to wait and see.""

But Landis said it was unlikely that Trump would push for all out regime change in Syria.

""[Trump's] entire policy for the Middle East has been based on reversing the notion of regime change. He supports strong men,"" he said.

""Now that he's got a strong man in Assad who is violating human rights and this norm of not using chemical weapons, he has to calibrate his policy and try to insist on human rights even as he supports dictators."""

Britain, France, and the United States presented a draft resolution demanding a full investigation of the attack on a rebel-held town in Idlib province, but Russia defended its ally in Damascus and said the text was ""categorically unacceptable"".

The draft resolution calls for a full investigation by the Organisation of the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) of the attack in the early hours of Tuesday in the town of Khan Sheikhoun.

If confirmed, the attack would be among the worst incidents of chemical weapons use in Syria's brutal civil war, which has killed nearly half a million people and displaced half the pre-war population.

Images and video published shortly after the incident showed dozens of men, women and children gasping for air , convulsing, and foaming at the mouth.

""Experts who've dealt with the gas say all the symptoms seem to indicate that Sarin was involved,"" Al Jazeera's Alan Fisher, reporting from Beirut.

The World Health Organization said there was reason to suspect a chemical attack, with some victims displaying symptoms suggesting exposure to ""a category of chemicals that includes nerve agents"".

Medical charity Medicins Sans Frontieres (MSF) said people it treated had symptoms consistent with nerve agents such as Sarin.

""MSF saw eight patients with symptoms - dilated pupils, muscle spasms, involuntary defecation - consistent with exposure to neuro-toxic agents such as Sarin,"" the group said in a statement.

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a Britain-based monitor, said at least 160 people suffered the effects of the gas.

The proposed measure requests the joint UN-OPCW investigative panel begin work immediately to identify the perpetrators of the attack.

The text also calls on Syria to provide flight plans, flight logs, and other information on its military operations on the day of the assault.

Damascus would be asked to provide the names of all commanders of helicopter squadrons to UN investigators and allow them to meet with generals and other high-ranking officials within five days of their request, the draft resolution said.

Syria would also allow UN and OPCW teams to visit air bases from which the attacks involving chemical weapons may have been launched.

Ahead of the emergency session on Wednesday, a spokeswoman for Russia's foreign ministry said the draft resolution was ""anti-Syrian"", adding it ""pre-empts the results of an investigation and just immediately designates the guilty"".

Moscow, which launched a military intervention in 2015 in support of Assad's forces, earlier defended Damascus against accusations of responsibility for the attack.

It said the deaths were caused when a Syrian air strike hit a ""terrorist warehouse"" used for making bombs containing ""toxic substances"", and pledged to continue its military support for Assad.

Syria's army has denied any use of chemical weapons, saying it ""has never used them, any time, anywhere, and will not do so in the future"".

Syria's permanent representative to the UN Munzer Munzer rejected what he called a ""falsification of the facts"" in Khan Sheikhoun, adding that ""terrorist groups"" had gained access to ""toxic chemicals"" with Turkish government assistance.

But Syria's denials did little to quiet international condemnation, with UN chief Antonio Guterres on Wednesday saying the ""horrific events"" showed that ""war crimes are going on in Syria"".

US Ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley said: ""How many more children have to die before Russia cares?""

Haley hinted that in light of a UN failure to prevent such attacks, certain states may be ""compelled to act"" on their own.

In a statement to the Security Council meeting, France’s Ambassador to the UN Francois Delattre refuted arguments made by Russia and the Syrian government.

""There was no fire, even though such a strike [on an alleged chemical warehouse] would have caused a fire, and the consequences would have been much more serious for the civilian population,"" he said.

UK Ambassador the UN Matthew Rycroft said the attack ""bears all the hallmarks fo the Assad regime"".

""There's only one air force that has used such weapons in Syria,"" he said.

Hospitals across Syria's rebel-held Idlib province are overwhelmed with casualties from a suspected chemical attack that has killed scores of people and wounded hundreds more, a local health official has told Al Jazeera.

The attack in the early hours of Tuesday morning in Khan Sheikhoun drew widespread international condemnation, with the UN saying it would investigate the bombing raid as a possible war crime.

Air raids targeted Khan Sheikhoun again on Wednesday morning, Hamid, a local official of the Syrian Civil Defence, a rescue group that operates in rebel-held areas, told Al Jazeera.

Munzir Khalil, head of Idlib's health directorate, said on Wednesday that medical workers were struggling to cope as the number of victims was expected to increase.

""We can confirm the names of 74 people killed,"" he said, ""but the hospitals expect the number to rise to 107 because many have gone missing and we suspect they have been killed in the attack.""

Khalil said at least 557 people were wounded in the attack and transferred to medical centres and field hospitals across Idlib, in Syria's northwest.

""I can say almost all of Idlib's medical facilities include victims of yesterday's attack. Not to forget, air strikes destroyed a central hospital in Maaret al-Numan on Monday, a facility that once took care of up to 30,000 patients a month.

""That hospital is now out of service and we are in a state of shock.""

Khalil said al-Rahma hospital in Khan Sheikhoun was also targeted by an air raid shortly after the suspected chemical attack.

The United Nations Security Council is expected to hold an emergency meeting later on Wednesday.

The UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR), the monitoring organisation, on Wednesday put the death toll at 99 people, including 37 children.

The Syrian American Medical Society (SAMS), which runs several field hospitals in Idlib, had earlier said that at least 72 people, including 11 children, were killed in the attack.

SAMS doctors on the ground said the attack caused people to vomit and foam at the mouth. Others lost consciousness and suffered muscle spasms.

The group said the symptoms, which also included constricted pupils and slow heart rates, were indicative of an organo-phosphorus compounds agent - a category of toxic gases which includes sarin.

The World Health Organization also said some survivors had symptoms consistent with exposure to a category of chemicals that includes nerve agents.

""The images and reports coming from Idlib today leave me shocked, saddened and outraged. These types of weapons are banned by international law because they represent an intolerable barbarism,"" Peter Salama, executive director of the UN agency's Health Emergencies Program, has said.

The Syrian National Coalition, an opposition group, said a gas similar to sarin was used in the attack, which it said was carried out by government fighter jets.

Syria's military rejected the accusation, saying in a statement on Tuesday that the army ""denies using any toxic or chemical agents in Khan Sheikhoun today, and it did not and never will use it anywhere"".

Russia, an ally of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, said on Wednesday that Syrian aircraft did carry out a raid, but the chemicals were part of a ""terrorist"" stockpile of ""toxic substances"" that had been struck on the ground.

The Hague-based Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons on Tuesday said that it was in the process of gathering and analysing information from all available sources.

If it is confirmed, it would be the deadliest chemical attack in Syria since sarin gas killed hundreds of civilians in Ghouta, just outside the capital Damascus, in August 2013."

A suspected chemical attack on a rebel-held town in Syria's Idlib province has drawn widespread international condemnation, with the United Nations saying it will investigate the bombing raid as a possible war crime.

At least 72 people, including 11 children, were killed in Khan Sheikhoun on Tuesday, according to the Syrian American Medical Society (SAMS), which runs several field hospitals in the area. More than 550 people were injured.

SAMS doctors on the ground said the attack caused people to vomit and foam from the mouth. Others lost consciousness and suffered muscle spasms.

The group said the symptoms, which also included constricted pupils and slow heart rate, were indicative of an organo-phosphorus compounds agent - a category of toxic gases which includes sarin.

""We were affected by the gas. We couldn't stand up,"" Veda Ajej, one of the survivors treated in a hospital in the Turkish town of Reyhanli, near the Syria border, told the Reuters news agency.

""I felt dizzy and nauseous,"" she said, lying in a hospital bed. ""I couldn't breathe.""

Local health workers said the death toll could rise and eventually reach 100. A member of the White Helmets, a rescue group that operates in rebel-held areas, told Al Jazeera that up to 300 people had been injured.

The Syrian National Coalition, an opposition group, said a gas similar to sarin was used in the attack, which it blamed on government planes.

UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres was ""deeply disturbed"" by the attack, his spokesman said, adding that the world body was ""currently not in a position to independently verify"" the reports of use of chemical weapons.

An emergency Security Council meeting was scheduled for Wednesday. The United States, Britain and France proposed a Security Council resolution that diplomats said would be likely to be put to a vote.

The draft text, seen by Reuters, says Syria's government must provide an international investigation with flight plans and logs for Tuesday, the names of all helicopter squadron commanders and provide access to air bases where investigators believe attacks using chemicals may have been launched.

If confirmed, it would be the deadliest chemical attack in Syria since sarin gas killed hundreds of civilians in Ghouta, near the capital, Damascus, in August 2013. Western states said the Syrian government was responsible for the 2013 attack. Damascus blamed rebels.

Khan Sheikhoun residents said the attack began in the early hours of Tuesday morning, when they heard planes in the sky followed by a series of loud explosions, after which people very quickly began to show symptoms. They said they could not identify the planes. Both Syrian and Russian jets have bombed the area before.

""My family and I were sleeping during the attack,"" Ahmed, another survivor treated in Reyhanli, told Reuters. ""The bombing was carried out and there was a big explosion. I felt dizzy and nauseous. I had trouble breathing - I don't remember the rest.""

This is the aftermath of a suspected chemical gas attack in Syria's Idlib.

Charles Duelfer, a chemical weapons expert in Washington DC, said it was ""unlikely"" that the attack was not the work of the Syrian regime.

""What changed is the nature of the agent,"" he told Al Jazeera. ""There were previous cases where the OPCW [Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons] and the UN have identified that the regime used a chemical but it's only been chlorine. This agent appears to be a military agent which is far more effective.""

Duelfer also said it was ""puzzling"" why government forces appeared to have resorted to using chemical weapons at a time when they are doing well militarily on the ground.

""They [chemical weapons] are not really serving a substantial military purpose. They can certainly spread terror, and they certainly seem to have a political effect, although it's hard for me to calculate how that would be a positive thing for Bashar al-Assad right now - unless he wants to demonstrate that he's there, no matter what anyone else says or wants to do about it.""

Turkish Prime Minister Binali Yildirim said Turkey hopes the UN will punish the attack's perpetrators in the name of humanity.

""The inhumane savagery in Idlib, Syria this morning, unfortunately, shocked all of us deeply,"" he said.

Britain and France also called for renewed efforts at the Security Council for those behind the use of toxic gas in the war to be held accountable.



Such attempts have been repeatedly blocked by Russia, Syria's main ally and a veto-wielding council member.

""This is clearly a war crime,"" British Ambassador Matthew Rycroft told reporters.

""I call on the Security Council members who have previously used their vetoes to defend the indefensible to change their course.""

The US said Assad must be held accountable for chemical weapons attacks and demanded that Russia and Iran bring their ally to heel.

""While we continue to monitor the terrible situation, it is clear that this is how Bashar al-Assad operates: with brutal, unabashed barbarism,"" Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said.

White House spokesman Sean Spicer told reporters that President Donald Trump was ""extremely alarmed"" by reports of the attack, which he called ""reprehensible"".

French President Francois Hollande accused the Syrian government of a ""massacre"".

""Once again the Syrian regime will deny the evidence of its responsibility for this massacre,"" he said in a statement.

On three previous occasions, UN investigations have found the Syrian army guilty of using chemical weapons.

In a statement, the UN Commission of Inquiry on Syria said the use of chemical weapons, as well as any deliberate targeting of medical facilities, ""would amount to war crimes and serious violations of human rights law"".

""It is imperative for perpetrators of such attacks to be identified and held accountable,"" said the independent panel led by Brazilian expert Paulo Pinheiro.

The European Union's top diplomat, Federica Mogherini, said: ""Obviously there is a primary responsibility from the regime because it has the primary responsibility of protecting its people."""

There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack, which came while President Vladimir Putin was visiting the city, his hometown.

The explosion occurred in mid-afternoon on Monday as the train travelled between stations in the centre of the city.

News reports initially said police were searching for two suspects, but the Interfax news agency later cited unspecified sources as saying police now suspect the blast was the work of a suicide bomber linked to ""radical Islamists"".

The National Anti-Terrorism Committee said it was looking for the ""perpetrators and organisers of the terror attack"".

Amateur video broadcast by Russian TV showed people lying on the platform of the Technological Institute station, and others bleeding and weeping just after the train pulled in with a huge hole ripped in the side of one of the carriages.

""When I turned back and looked, there was a huge number of people lying there. There were dead bodies,"" said Natalya Kirrillova, a witness.

""It was scary. And when we left, they took out several people covered in blood. [There was] a woman, her whole face was a massive wound.""

Second device

Within two hours of the blast, authorities had found and deactivated another bomb at another busy station, Vosstaniya Square, the anti-terror agency said. That station is a major transfer point for passengers on two lines and serves the railway station to Moscow.

Interfax cited an unidentified law enforcement official saying that investigators think the suspected suicide bomber left the bomb at the Vosstaniya Square station before blowing himself up on the train.

Attacks in Russia 2013: Suicide bombers targeted a train station and a trolley bus in Volgograd. At least 34 killed. 2011: 37 people died in a suicide bombing at one of Moscow's international airports. Chechen fighters claimed responsibility. 2010: Suicide bombers detonated bombs in the Moscow metro, killing 38. A Chechen group claimed the attack. 2009: At least 28 killed when a high-speed rail link between Moscow and St Petersburg was hit by a suicide attack. Chechen fighters were held responsible.

Putin, who was meeting the president of Belarus at the Constantine Palace on the city's outskirts, offered condolences on national television.

""Law enforcement agencies and intelligence services are doing their best to establish the cause and give a full picture of what happened,"" said the Russian president.

Three days of mourning began on Tuesday.

The UN Security Council condemned ""in the strongest terms the barbaric and cowardly terrorist attack"", adding that the ""perpetrators, organisers, financiers and sponsors"" should be brought to justice.

US President Donald Trump said it was ""absolutely a terrible thing"". White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said the US was prepared to offer assistance to Russia.

Lebanon's Hezbollah group, which is backing Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's forces along with Russia, said the incident was the type of ""terrorism"" Russia was fighting in Syria.

In the past two decades, Russian trains and planes have been frequent targets of attacks, most of them connected to the insurgency in Chechnya and other Caucasus republics in the southern part of the country.

Two female suicide bombers killed 40 people and wounded more than 100 in the Moscow metro in March 2010. Chechen rebel leader Doku Umarov claimed responsibility for the attack, warning Russian leaders that ""the war is coming to their cities"".

A Moscow-to-St Petersburg train was bombed in November 2009, in an attack that left 28 dead and 100 injured. Umarov's group said he ordered this attack."

Russian authorities opened a criminal case over Monday's explosion on charges of a ""terrorist act"", but said they would also consider all other possible causes. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the bombing.

According to Russian media reports, investigators suspect that the attack was carried out by a suicide bomber who left an explosive device at a metro station, and then boarded the train with another device in a backpack.

Ambulances and fire engines descended on the central Sennaya Ploshchad metro station after the blast at around 2:40pm (11:40 GMT).

Russian media initially reported that there were two explosions, but officials later said that there was only one blast which happened as the train was moving between the Sennaya Ploshchad and the Tekhnologichesky Institut stations.

Hours later, police found and deactivated a second explosive device at another metro station, one of the city's busiest, sending a wave of fear across St Petersburg.

After a few hours of differing casualty tolls, the National Anti-Terrorism Committee said the death toll was 11, with another 45 people being treated for wounds in hospitals.

A huge hole was blasted in the side of the carriage, with metal wreckage strewn across the platform. Passengers were seen hammering at the windows of one closed carriage.

""Everything was covered in smoke, there were a lot of firefighters,"" Maria Smirnova, a student on a train behind the one with the bomb, told a Russian TV station. ""Firefighters shouted at us to run for the exit and everyone ran. Everyone was panicking.""

Social media users also posted photographs and video from the scene of the blast, showing people lying on the floor and a train with a mangled door nearby.

Russian President Vladimir Putin, who was visiting St Petersburg, his hometown, to attend an economic forum, offered his condolences to the victims' families.

""I have already spoken to the head of our special services. They are working to ascertain the cause [of the blast],"" the Russian president said.

""The causes are not clear. It's too early. We will look at all possible causes, terrorism as well as common crime,"" he added.

He later laid flowers outside the station where the damaged train arrived after the explosion.

Authorities in St Petersburg closed all of the city's metro stations following the blast. About three million people in Russia's second-largest city use the metro daily.

""We also understand that security is being beefed up on the Moscow metro system and other transportation hubs in big Russian cities,"" Al Jazeera's Rory Challands, reporting from the capital, said.

""The Russians are preparing themselves for a potential series of attacks and they are doing what they can at the moment to try to prevent any more incidents like this from happening.""

For years, Russian cities, including their transportation systems, had faced bomb attacks from Chechen fighters and other groups in the Caucasus, but gradually they decreased.

At least 38 people were killed in 2010 when two female suicide bombers detonated bombs on packed Moscow metro trains.

A suicide raid on the capital's Domodedovo airport that was claimed by fighters from the North Caucasus killed 37 people in January 2011.

Security analysts pointed out recently that the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL, also known as ISIS) group had been threatening Russia, and had claimed responsibility for an attack in Chechnya that killed six Russian soldiers.

Russia is a staunch ally of Syria's President Bashar al-Assad and has been bombing rebel-held areas since September 2015.

According to monitoring groups, Russian air raids in Syria have killed more than 10,000 people, including nearly 4,000 civilians.

Simon Mabon, a lecturer in international relations at Lancaster University, told Al Jazeera that the blast in St Petersburg had the ""hallmarks of a number of different groups, but the ultimate goal is to cause fear and strike at the heart of the Russian state""."
12,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/02/de-mistura-expects-breakthrough-syria-talks-170222181756359.html,UN's de Mistura expects no breakthrough in Syria talks,"Geneva, Switzerland - The United Nations mediator for the talks on the war in Syria, Staffan de Mistura, has played down expectations for major progress before planned negotiations in the Swiss city of Geneva.

""Am I expecting a breakthrough? No, I am not expecting a breakthrough,"" he told journalists at the UN headquarters on Wednesday, a day before the start of the fourth round of talks aimed at finding a political solution to Syria's long-running conflict.

Though the Geneva talks are seen as the most serious diplomatic effort in months, disputes over the agenda and long-standing disagreements between the opposition and the government on the future of Syria have cast doubts on whether any progress will be achieved.

READ MORE: After six years of war, low hopes for Syria peace talks

De Mistura said he was determined to maintain ""a very proactive momentum"" to allow for political discussions on governance, a new constitution and elections under UN supervision, based on the UN Security Council Resolution 2254.

In recent days, however, the UN mediator has shied away from using the phrase ""political transition"" - a term the Syrian opposition equates with the removal of President Bashar al-Assad - to describe the goal of the talks.

During previous rounds of UN-led negotiations, the Syrian government categorically refused to discuss Assad's fate - the main bone of contention between the two sides.

Opposition divisions

The intra-Syrian talks come on the heels of multilateral meetings - facilitated by Russia, Turkey and Iran - in the Kazakh capital of Astana to consolidate a fragile nationwide truce brokered by Russia and Turkey, in place since December 30.

The negotiations in Astana were meant to pave the way towards political negotiations in Geneva, but the ceasefire has steadily fallen apart over the past month, while promises to establish a monitoring mechanism were not fulfilled.

Officials from the opposition delegation, split between military and political representatives, similarly expressed little hope for the talks.

""When the adherence to the ceasefire is not there,"" and when there are ""games being played at the level of international terms of reference to political transition and a constitution [...] then the negotiations are not encouraging,"" Yehya al-Aridi, adviser to the High Negotiations Committee, the main opposition umbrella organisation, told Al Jazeera.

""Things are getting complicated further and further, with conflicting agendas. Not only from the main two banks of the conflict, but also within our bank,"" he told Al Jazeera.

Infighting within rebel ranks has severely weakened and divided the Syrian opposition over the past month.

That, coupled with uncertainty surrounding US policy on Syria under President Donald Trump, a shift in the priorities of Turkey - traditionally a backer of Syrian rebel groups - and Russia's 2015 military intervention in support of Assad, has left the opposition with little leverage, either politically or militarily.

""There are no solutions in sight now. The reality on the ground is getting worse,"" Fares Bayoush, a Free Syrian Army commander, told Al Jazeera.

Omar Kouch, a Syrian analyst, said that while the presence of a ceasefire makes this round of talks markedly different, ""there are no indications that the fourth Geneva talks will be serious about finding a solution"".

Kouch said the chances for reaching a solution are slim, citing the continued government offensives on several areas across Syria, the absence of the dominant Syrian Kurdish faction - the Democratic Unity Party (PYD) - at the negotiating table and major divisions within the opposition.

""As in every round of talks, we start with a lot of hope to find a solution, but then the talks are over and nothing is accomplished. In fact, things get worse,"" he told Al Jazeera.

With both sides seemingly unwilling to make political concessions, it is unclear how the negotiations could bridge the divide and find a solution.

Still, the Syrian opposition is expected to press for the consolidation of the ceasefire, the release of prisoners, the lifting of the blockades over besieged areas and securing a political transition from Assad’s government.

""The main thing is that there is no submission. We are trying very hard, to decrease the losses,"" said Aridi."
14,https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2017/02/struggle-aleppo-story-takes-skies-170221105309042.html,Struggle over Aleppo's story takes to the skies,"New technologies open new windows for political action. They give new tools to the powerful and their challengers. In the Syrian city of Aleppo, the struggle to frame the conflict for the international community ran parallel to the battle for control over the land itself.

While drone footage from Russia Today showed videos of rebel-held and heavily-bombed eastern Aleppo, Syria's Ministry of Tourism published footage of the city's intact western half, complete with the soundtrack from HBO's hit show Game of Thrones. The contrast was stark. Life with the regime was normal. Life with the rebels was hell.

Monther Etaky remembered that ""the regime was always looking down from the drone"". An Aleppo native, working as a journalist during the siege, Etaky and his colleague Abdalrahman Ismail were frustrated by this distortion. They were not alone. They joined a handful of independent journalists to tell the other side of the story.

The next step was as simple as it was familiar to activists the world over: they bought their own drone. Suddenly, the journalists were working simultaneously along two frontlines; one physical and the other symbolic.

""When I first flew the drone for myself, I saw the destruction of the city. I'm used to seeing the destruction from the ground, but not from the sky … it looks wider than from the ground,"" Monther says. At the time, both men were contributing to Life in Aleppo, a grassroots effort to raise awareness of the siege.

""The regime is the greatest criminal on the planet,"" Monther told us. With Assad's planes occupying the skies every day of the past five years, Aleppo earned titles such as the world's most dangerous city and Syria's barrel-bomb capital.

Undermining official narratives

The group's footage undermined official narratives of the war's progress while challenging humanitarian consciousness worldwide.

This is true in struggles well beyond Syria, as new technologies give regimes new means of control, at the same time challengers gain new tools for documenting abuses and spreading the word about important causes.

Long gone are the halcyon days in which tech boosters could claim that the information highway would deliver the democratic goods.

In the United States, the 2016 election has removed any doubt that new digital technologies cut both ways.

Drones are no exception: most viewed drone footage of Aleppo is not from Monther, Abdalrahman and their colleagues. What folks watch the most is Youtube footage from Russian outlets like Russia Today and Ruptly.

Some titles are generic ""Drone footage captures devastation of east Aleppo"" and others are clearly political: ""Drone footage shows fierce clashes between Syrian Army & US-backed Islamic terrorists.""

That contrast couldn't have been clearer, Abdalrahman remembered, ""When we are besieged, we, all the time, see the drones of the Assad regime flying over the city,"" their footage ""telling lies"".

Taking to the sky

A recent analysis of non-violent drone use found that around the world Abdalrahman and Monther's usage is growing, as drones provide new perspectives on factory farming, industrial animal facilities, environmental degradation, and poaching (PDF).

Drones allow advocacy groups to see over walls, peer deep into inaccessible rainforests, and capture footage from just across town. Indeed, one of the first things Monther and his young colleagues did was to fly a drone over their university, which they hadn't seen in five years.

Drones allow advocacy groups to see over walls, peer deep into inaccessible rainforests, and capture footage from just across town.

Around the world, drones are taking to the sky, increasing public apprehension about the devices. Syria is no exception.

When they first started flying, people assumed it belonged to the regime, ""They said it's a spy drone, we should shoot that drone down, so it's not targeting our neighbourhoods.""

Frequent flights and some neighbourly outreach prevented the drone's downing by friendly fire.

Nevertheless, Abdalrahman and Monther estimate that they lost 20 drones over the course of the conflict. These losses are due to risky flights that basically involves ""gambling to take good footage from regime areas,"" but they are also the result of the regime's efforts to shoot down their devices, or jam their control signals.

Such are the basic back and forth struggles between regimes and challengers.

OPINION: Whitewashing Assad and his allies must be challenged

For now, the struggle has subsided, as both Abdalrahman and Monther fled Aleppo as Syrian and Russian troops moved in.

Their departure was marked by a final insult, Monther remembered: ""I lost three laptops and a drone - the Russian officer stole it from the bus where I was. As part of the forced evacuation agreement, they were not allowed to open bags - guns weren't allowed, and I didn't have guns, but they saw the laptops, which is the worst gun for them.""

The cat and mouse game of emancipatory uses and state control of new technologies plays on. Both men continue their efforts from the northwestern Syrian countryside; only this time without a drone.

The advance into the province, most of which is under the control of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL, also known as ISIS), is part of an operation to encircle and ultimately capture its de facto Syrian capital of Raqqa in the north of the country.

One aim of the campaign is to cut ISIL's supply lines from Raqqa to Deir Az Zor province.

The move also expands the SDF's area of operations against ISIL, which is being fought by all sides in the complex Syria conflict.

Later on Tuesday, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR), a UK-based monitoring group, reported that at least 11 people were killed and more than 35 wounded in air strikes in a town in northern Deir Az Zor province, in an area where US-led coalition warplanes have operated.

It was not clear whose air force had carried out the strikes, or if the incident was linked to the SDF advance, the Observatory said.

""Military operations of the SDF are now taking place within the provincial boundaries of [Deir Az Zor], from the north - so, via southern Hasaka (province),"" the Kurdish military source told Reuters news agency.

The SDF, which includes the Kurdish YPG militia and other Arab fighting groups, captured some 15 villages from ISIL fighters in their incursion into the province, the source added, without specifying when this had taken place.

ISIL controls most of Deir Az Zor province apart from a Syrian government-held enclave in Deir Az Zor city and a nearby military airbase.

Different groups in Syria's multi-sided conflict are fighting a number of separate battles against ISIL.

Syria's army and its allies, backed by Russia, have been fighting back against ISIL assaults in Deir Az Zor city and have engaged in clashes with the group further west.

Humanitarian concerns

Turkish-backed Syrian rebels, meanwhile, are fighting for control of the northern city of Al Bab, which monitors say is still mostly in ISIL hands, but which the rebels have pushed into.

That battle has brought the Turkish-backed rebels into close proximity with Syrian government forces, which had advanced towards the city from another direction before the rebels entered it.

The Syrian army's advance towards Al Bab has raised fears of sparking a confrontation with Turkey.

The United Nations said on Tuesday that an estimated 5,000 civilians were trapped by fighting in and around Al Bab and that 300 non-combatants had been killed since December, many of them by air strikes.

Turkey and Russia have both been carrying out air strikes around the city.

""As the operation advances, parties to the conflict may be preparing for urban battles ... which could place civilians in the area at heightened risk of death and injury, as well as (making them) vulnerable to being used as human shields,"" the UN's humanitarian coordination body said in a statement.

The air strikes in the town of al-Sur in Deir Az Zor on Tuesday hit a garage, petrol station and commercial area, the Observatory reported.

Geneva talks

The UN-led talks on Syria's future will resume in Geneva on Thursday after UN envoy Staffan de Mistura broke them off almost nine months ago following several rounds that led ultimately to an escalation of violence.

De Mistura's office said that the focus of the meeting will be on governance, a new constitution and elections.

It stressed that ""the entire agenda for the Geneva negotiations will be framed by the broader corpus of Security Council resolutions"".

A spokesperson for the UN said on Friday that de Mistura was still finalising who would come to the meeting, but there were already positive responses to invitations that had gone out.

Thursday's talks in Geneva will follow last month's Russian-sponsored parallel peace talks on Syria in the capital of Kazakhstan, Astana.

Those talks ended with no joint communique, usually the minimum outcome of any diplomatic negotiation, and saw opposing Syrian groups trading angry accusations.

Russia proposed the intra-Syrian negotiations in coordination with Turkey and Iran to reinforce a shaky ceasefire.

Five years since the civil war began, more than 450,000 Syrians have been killed in the fighting, more than a million injured and over 12 million Syrians - half the country's prewar population - have been displaced from their homes."

Iran summoned the Turkish ambassador in Tehran on Monday over comments made by Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu and President Tayyip Erdogan, accusing the Islamic Republic of destabilising the region.

Turkey and Iran have been regional rivals for centuries, but have sought to forge a pragmatic relationship in recent years, with Iran strongly supporting President Erdogan after last year's failed coup.

Turkey, a country with a Sunni majority, and Shia Iran have been on opposite sides of the conflict in Syria, with Ankara seeking to overthrow President Bashar al-Assad and Tehran being, along with Russia, his key backer.

Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu lashed out at Iran in a speech to the Munich Security Conference at the weekend, saying some of its actions had undermined security in the region and urging Tehran to promote stability.

""Iran wants to make Syria and Iraq Shia,"" he said, quoted by Turkish state media.

""Turkey is very much against any kind of division, religious or sectarian,"" he said.

Erdogan also accused Iran of promoting a ""Persian nationalism"" that had damaged the Middle East.

""There is Persian nationalism here, we have to prevent this. We cannot just watch this oppression,"" Erdogan said on a visit to Bahrain on February 14.

Iran's warning

The Iranian foreign ministry spokesman Bahram Ghassemi warned on Monday that Tehran's patience ""had limits"" after Tehran summoned the Turkish ambassador over Turkish remarks.

""We hope that such statements are not made again. If our Turkish friends continue with this attitude we will not remain silent,"" he added.

Turkey's foreign ministry spokesman Huseyin Muftuoglu hit back by saying it was ""incomprehensible"" to receive such accusations from Tehran, whom he charged with ""not hesitating to push into warzones refugees sheltering from regional crises.

READ MORE: Russia, Turkey, Iran agree plan to support Syria truce

""Instead of accusing countries that have criticised Iran, it should take constructive steps and review its own regional policies.""

The angry exchanges have come just after Erdogan returned from a week-long tour of the Arabian peninsula, including talks with the leadership of Iran's arch regional foe and Ankara's Sunni ally Saudi Arabia.

Harmony between Turkey and Iran is crucial in ensuring the preservation of a fragile ceasefire in Syria, which is also backed by Russia.

The ceasefire came into force at the end of last year as a basis for peace talks."

Life of a career diplomat Churkin had served as foreign ministry spokesman in the early 1990s and as special envoy to the former Yugoslavia. Growing up in Moscow, he dabbled in acting in his early teens, notably in two films about Soviet founding father Vladimir Lenin. He graduated from the prestigious Moscow Institute of International Relations and began his career at the foreign ministry as a translator before working at the Soviet embassy in Washington in the 1980s. Given his long posting at the UN - previously held for a decade by Russia's current Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov - Churkin joked in a recent interview that his stint was surpassed only by the envoy from Turkmenistan. He is survived by his wife Irina, son Maxim and daughter Anastasiya.

Churkin collapsed while at work at the Russian mission to the UN on Monday morning and was taken to a Manhattan hospital, apparently suffering from heart problems, diplomatic sources told AFP news agency.

In a statement announcing his death, the foreign ministry in Moscow described him as an ""outstanding diplomat"".

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said President Vladimir Putin ""highly valued the professionalism and diplomatic talent of Vitaly Churkin"" and offered condolences, Interfax reported

Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova paid tribute, writing on Facebook: ""A great diplomat. An extraordinary personality. An outstanding individual. We have lost someone very dear.""

News of his death was met with shock at UN headquarters where Churkin, who would have turned 65 on Tuesday, had been a towering presence for a decade.

UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said Churkin had served ""with distinction through some of the most challenging and momentous periods of recent history"".

Guterres described him as a ""forceful presence on the Security Council"", a ""uniquely skilled diplomat, a powerful orator with great wit and a man of many talents and interests"".

Diplomats at a UN meeting observed a moment of silence and a tribute to him was planned at the Security Council on Tuesday.

Petr Iliichev, Russia's deputy UN ambassador, said Churkin was worked ""until his last moments"".

""His whole life was dedicated to defending the interests of Russia,"" Iliichev said. ""He was on the frontline ... We've lost a prominent diplomat, a strong negotiator, a wonderful individual, a teacher.""

UN spokesman Farhan Haq, who was informed of Churkin's death during a daily briefing, offered his condolences.

""He has been such a regular presence here that I'm actually quite stunned,"" Haq said.

Western rift

A career diplomat born in Moscow who studied English from a young age, Churkin had been UN ambassador since April 2006, after serving as Russian ambassador to Canada and to Belgium.

Recently, relations between Russia and the West have soured, culminating with a major rift over Moscow's support for separatists in east Ukraine and its military intervention in Syria.

In his final months, Churkin clashed repeatedly with then-US ambassador Samantha Power over the bloodshed in Syria's Aleppo, staunchly defending Moscow's view that the Syrian government was waging all-out war against ""terrorists"".

Russia resorted to its veto six times to block action on Syria.

Power tweeted that she was ""devastated"" and described Churkin as a ""diplomatic maestro"" who did all he could to bridge US-Russian differences.

Power's successor, Nikki Haley, who arrived less than a month ago, said Churkin had ""showed himself to be a gracious colleague"".

""We did not always see things the same way, but he unquestionably advocated his country's positions with great skill,"" said Haley in a statement.

Francois Delattre, Churkin's French counterpart, said he was ""one of the most talented diplomats"" and ""an exceptional representative of Russia.

Matthew Rycroft, Britain's ambassador to the UN, tweeted that he was ""absolutely devastated"", describing Churkin as ""a diplomatic giant & wonderful character""."

The five biggest exporters - the United States, Russia, China, France and Germany - accounted for 74 percent of total arms exports, according to research published on Monday by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI).

In the Middle East, arms imports jumped by 86 percent between 2012 and 2016, accounting for 29 percent of global weapons purchases. The increase was nearly double from the previous five-year period studied.

Saudi Arabia was the world's second largest arms importer in 2012-16 with an increase of 212 percent on 2007–11. Weapon imports by neighbouring Qatar , meanwhile, surged 245 percent.

The majority of other states in the Middle East also increased arms imports, although at a lower rate than the Gulf nations.

""Despite low oil prices, countries in the region continued to order more weapons in 2016, perceiving them as crucial tools for dealing with conflicts and regional tensions,"" Pieter Wezeman, senior researcher with the SIPRI Arms and Military Expenditure Programme, told Al Jazeera.

""Saudi Arabia and the UAE take the lead in what is one of their first efforts to intervene in a neighbouring country [ Yemen ] all by themselves, and they can do so because over the years they have acquired these large amounts of advanced weapons.""

Conflicts in Syria , Iraq and Yemen have led to hundreds of thousands of deaths over the past few years.

India was the world's largest importer of major arms in 2012-16, accounting for 13 percent of the global total - far greater than regional rivals China and Pakistan, SIPRI reported.

""With no regional arms control instruments in place, states in Asia continue to expand their arsenals,"" said Wezeman.

""While China is increasingly able to substitute arms imports with indigenous products, India remains dependent on weapons technology from many willing suppliers, including Russia , the US, European states, Israel and South Korea.""

Countries opposed to President Bashar al-Assad, including the US, back efforts by the UN to broker a political solution to the conflict, Sigmar Gabriel, Germany's foreign minister, said on Friday.

""It is clear that all who met want a political solution ... and that this political solution must be achieved in Geneva under the auspices of the United Nations and that there cannot be any parallel negotiations,"" Gabriel said after a meeting in Bonn that included the US, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, France and the UK.

The countries were meeting for the first time since Donald Trump took office as US president in a bid to find common ground in advance of the Geneva meeting.

Gabriel said Rex Tillerson, the new US secretary of state, played an active role in the discussions about how to end the war in Syria, which took place on the sidelines of a meeting in Bonn, Germany, of G20 foreign ministers.

Tillerson, trying to reassure allies that the US was not tilting towards Russia over the Syrian conflict, told them that the US-backed UN efforts to broker a political solution to the war, officials and diplomats said.

He also said military ties with Russia depended on its stance towards rebels fighting the Assad government, whom Russia backs.

All eyes have been on the US and its approach to ending the violence in Syria, given promises by Trump to build closer ties to Russia.

Speaking alongside Gabriel, Jean-Marc Ayrault, France's foreign minister, said the Geneva talks would ultimately fail if Russia did not use its influence on the Syrian government and Iran to stop labelling all those opposed to Assad as ""terrorists"".

Parallel peace talks

On Thursday, Sergey Lavrov, Russian foreign minister, said the US supported Russian-sponsored parallel peace talks on Syria in the capital of Kazakhstan, Astana.

Those talks ended with no joint communique, usually the minimum outcome of any diplomatic negotiation, and saw opposing Syrian groups trading angry accusations.

Russia proposed a series of parallel intra-Syrian negotiations in coordination with Turkey and Iran last year in Astana to reinforce a shaky ceasefire.

It has tried to expand the scope to cover political aspects, a move that has been criticised by Western and Arab states, who argue that UN efforts are the only credible track for a political solution.

With its show of military force, Russia changed the tide of the Syrian civil war. However, it is finding the next phase - brokering an end to the fighting - a tougher proposition.

Russia's peace drive started hopefully, with the first Astana meeting in January.

The Syrian rebels and government came together for the first time in nine months, and agreement was reached to consolidate a shaky ceasefire.

But for the second round this week, the Syrian rebels debated until the eleventh hour about whether to attend at all, finally sending a smaller delegation which arrived in Astana a day late.

Bashar Jaafari, the Syrian government negotiator, said on Thursday that peace talks in Astana had not produced a communique because of the ""irresponsible"" late arrival of rebel participants and their Turkish backers which delayed the joint session by a day.

He also criticised the rebels and Turkey for downgrading their delegations from the previous meeting.

""Turkey cannot ignite the fire and at the same time act as a firefighter,"" he said after the talks.

The rebels, in turn, accused the Syrian government and Iran of routinely violating the ceasefire and Russia of failing to enforce it.

""We know that the Russians have a problem with those for whom they are guarantors,"" Yahya al-Aridi, a rebel negotiator, said, referring to Iran and Assad's forces.

'No common ground'

Haid Haid, an associate fellow with the Middle East and North Africa Programme at the London-based Chatham House, says the prospects of the Astana talks' success were bleak due to virtually ""no common ground between Turkey, Russia and Iran"".

Speaking to Al Jazeera on Thursday, he said: ""In order to implement the ceasefire, they have to punish those who violate ceasefires.

""[But] Russia and Iran do not want to put any pressure on the Syrian regime ... There are no enforcement mechanisms that could be a stepping stone to a political solution.""

Five years since the civil war began, more than 450,000 Syrians have been killed in the fighting, more than a million injured and over 12 million Syrians - half the country's prewar population - have been displaced from their homes."

Russian jets targeted rebel-held areas of Deraa for two days after Syrian opposition groups on Sunday stormed the heavily garrisoned Manshiya district in a campaign that sought to obstruct any army attempts to capture a strategic border crossing with Jordan from the opposition.

A rebel source said that there were at least 30 Russian sorties on Tuesday, thwarting further rebel gains in the heavily defended enclave that had allowed them so far to secure significant parts of the Manshiya.

""When the regime began to lose control of some areas ... the Russian jets began their operations,"" said Ibrahim Abdullah, a senior rebel commander.

Al Jazeera could not independently confirm the reported Russian assault.

SPECIAL SERIES: The boy who started the Syrian war

The army's control of the rebel-held crossing and chunks of territory in the southern strip of Deraa would sever the rebel link between the eastern and west parts of the province.

The Syrian army said the ""terrorists"" had failed to make gains and its troops had inflicted many casualties.

The opposition fighters are drawn from both moderate Free Syrian Army groups and members of a newly formed alliance - Tahrir al-Sham.

The fighting spread across other parts of Deraa as rebels fired mortars on government-controlled parts of the province.

Ground-to-ground missiles were also deployed from army barracks to hit rebel-held quarters of Deraa, residents said.

The battles inside the city are the most intense since an alliance of mainstream rebels, known as the Southern Front, who are backed by western and Arab foes of President Bashar al-Assad, launched an unsuccessful large-scale military campaign to capture the whole city in 2015.

The Syrian army has so far failed to recapture the border crossing, a once thriving passenger and commercial gateway with Jordan, despite repeated efforts.

READ MORE: Syria's civil war explained

At least half of the southern province is in the hands of FSA fighters but groups affiliated with the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant group (ISIL) have a foothold in an area to the west of Deraa in the Wadi Yarmouk area, near the Golan Heights.

Aid workers said fighter jets hit a western-funded field hospital in Deraa and raids killed at least seven members of one family in the border area, where many residents fled in the early days of the Syrian conflict.

The Washington-based International Rescue Committee, which supports the hospital that was targeted, said in a statement that four health workers were injured in the attack.

Talks in Astana

The fighting in Deraa comes against a backdrop of renewed diplomatic activity.

Russia, Turkey and Iran are hosting the second round of talks in Kazakhstan's capital, Astana, on extending the Syrian ceasefire.

Syria's opposition delegation said it received a commitment from the Russians that they would immediately halt their air strikes on areas held by the opposition.

The head of the Syrian government delegation blamed rebel negotiators for a lack of overall progress after they arrived late to the talks.









Haid Haid, an associate fellow with the Middle East and North Africa Programme at the London-based Chatham House, says the prospects of the talks achieving any real solution to the Syrian conflict are lacking due to virtually ""no common ground between Turkey, Russia and Iran"".

Speaking to Al Jazeera, he said: ""In order to implement the ceasefire, they have to punish those who violate ceasefires.

""And Russia and Iran do not want to put any pressure on the Syrian regime ... There are no enforcement mechanisms that could be a stepping stone to a political solution.""

Five years since the conflict began, more than 450,000 Syrians have been killed in the fighting, more than a million injured and over 12 million Syrians - half the country's prewar population - have been displaced from their homes."
22,https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2017/02/elections-france-security-170215090123247.html,Elections in France: It's all about security,"According to latest opinion polls, security issues remain the primary concern of French voters for May's presidential elections. Security stands ahead of social issues, including unemployment which is cruising at an average 10 percent, and the future of the social security system that is threatened by the need for further cuts in public finances.

This stems from the context of the persistent terrorist threats weighing on the country after the wave of attacks which started in 2015, furthered by presidential candidates who are fuelling fear to lend credence to their programmes and rally a very dubious and volatile electorate.

Focusing on France's specific concept of secularism - something no one knows how to implement any more - has become a convenient way for candidates to avoid addressing the sensitive issue of Islam in France head on.

As such, the candidates are also avoiding the risk of facing accusations of Islamophobia and creating an amalgam between Islam and terrorism.

Secularism is de facto used as an adjustment variable to define how to reassert French identity, culture, tradition, roots, and secure France from any attempt to change its ""core DNA"".

This definition marks the split, dividing French society into two camps in a political battle: is today's diversity of race and religion, globalisation and immigration an opportunity or a threat?

Fearmongering against Muslims

For Marine Le Pen's far-right National Front, which, with 26 percent, currently leads voters' intentions in the first round, France must barricade itself from outsiders to guarantee both its unity and security.

In accordance with the ""Appeased France"" campaign slogan, she is casting her traditional net wider.

Muslims are not our enemies but ""Republic-compatible"" citizens, provided that they accept assimilation as ""secular Muslims"" in a Christian-rooted society.

The real enemy of the nation is radical Islam, that she pledges to bring to its knees, and its twin brother, jihadism.

On the domestic front, she maintains that shutting down Salafi mosques, kicking foreign imams preaching hate out of the country, forbidding foreign funding to Muslim organisations, deporting dual citizens with jihadi links and stripping them of their French nationality when they return to France from the jihadi fronts.

All these positions are equally shared by the candidate of the main right-wing party, The Republicans, Francois Fillon - whose fate is still uncertain since the ""Penelopegate"" scandal - with some ""minor"" differences.

For the former prime minister Fillon, running on a ""stand-up"" vision for France, banning the radical expression on French soil as part of the fight against ""Islamic totalitarianism"" includes Salafism, as well Muslim Brotherhood and Wahhabism.

The two candidates agree on the need to reinforce controls over national borders and to stop welcoming refugees for security and social reasons. Fillon also calls, for ""reviewing our diplomatic relations with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia"", and expects clarifications on its ""ambiguous role"" in exporting extremist ideologies worldwide, including to Europe and France.

Le Pen has conveniently avoided addressing this issue in public. Yet she and Fillon both consider Russia as an ally in the fight against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) in Syria and Iraq, breaking with the Socialist government's line under Francois Hollande's presidency, shared by Benoit Hamon, the Socialist primary's elected candidate, which denounces Russian operations as ""war crimes"". Hamon was part of the ""defiant"" trend within the left-wing party.

The security front

Advocates of the hardline secularism waging war against the ""useful idiots"" of Islamism - political jargon for an ignorant or naive person used by propagandist leaders to spread their message - refer to Benoit Hamon as ""Bilal Hamon"".

Indeed, Hamon calls for a more effective and preventive approach to defeat radicalism and terrorism rather than a solely repressive approach, which he feels exposes France to more terrorism as it discriminates and divides, thereby serving the enemy's agenda.

Unlike his opponents, Hamon's campaign slogan ""Make France's heart beat"" refers to traditional left-wing values and more specifically to a tradition of generosity and tolerance - or what remains of them.

The state of emergency, which has been extended five times since November 2015, cannot become a permanent extraordinary response to meet terrorist threats.

He advocates investing in efforts for social cohesion rather than increasing prison capacity, using diplomatic initiatives to resolve crises rather than military engagements, and the better integration of refugees rather than targeted accusations that they are damaging France's soul and its security.

Seemingly close to his stance, is Emmanuel Macron, who served two years as Hollande's minister of the economy, before quitting last August to launch his own independent movement ""Forward"" and entering the presidential race as an ""unidentified political object"" - as a former investment banker he disclaims any political affiliation, promoting a ""neither right nor left"" political stance.

Despite not yet delivering his political programme, he is currently second in the polls, ahead of Fillon thanks to the ""Penelopegate"", which has damaged the self-proclaimed person-of-virtue's popularity. Fillon's campaign has been based on public morality and his own alleged probity.

For the young Macron - he is 39 - ""it is a mistake to consider that the programme is the heart"" of an election campaign, given that ""style"" and ""heart"" are more decisive. However, when it comes to security matters, he distils a more general formula, mainly echoing Hamon's proposals.

Despite these divergences, points of convergence emerge from the two dividing camps in France's current presidential campaign on how to tackle terrorist threats.

OPINION: Fillon's victory - A political earthquake in France

The state of emergency, which has been extended five times since November 2015, cannot become a permanent response to meet terrorist threats. The capabilities of intelligence and security forces need to be reinforced and better coordinated.

As for addressing the real roots of radicalisation and terrorism in French society - such as social and economic marginalisation, inequality of opportunities, foreign policy choices - efforts that would outlast a generation are needed.

It is far longer than a five-year presidential mandate, so let's pass the buck to our successors…

""The negotiations have been moved to February 16 for technical reasons,"" a spokeswoman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs told AFP news agency by telephone without elaboration.

Syrian rebels cast doubt on Monday over whether they would attend the talks, accusing Russia of failing to get Damascus to comply fully with a ceasefire or take any confidence-building steps.

Kazakhstan, Moscow's close political ally, said last week the two-day talks, to which the UN special envoy for Syria, Staffan de Mistura, had also been invited, would focus on consolidating the Syrian ceasefire.

A new round of UN-backed peace talks is due to begin in Geneva next.

The ""closed format"" negotiations come after representatives from Damascus and the armed opposition failed to make a breakthrough at indirect talks in the city in January.

The meeting, pushed by key regime-supporter Moscow, is viewed as a warm-up for UN-led negotiations on the protracted war that are due to begin in Geneva on February 23.

While Kazakh officials said they invited both the Syrian government and rebels for the new talks, several of the regime opponents who took part in the previous Astana talks told AFP that they have not received invitations.

OPINION: How far is Russia willing to go in Syria?

Russia is sending Alexander Lavrentiev, presidential envoy, while Iran said it is dispatching Deputy Foreign Minister Hossein Jaberi Ansari.

De Mistura said he would not participate personally in the latest Astana meeting but that his office would be represented by a ""technical team"".

Jordan will also be represented by a ""high-level delegation"" government spokesman Mohamed Momani said.

The Astana initiative has left the West on the sidelines of the latest push to end the war in Syria that has claimed more than 300,000 lives since 2011.

Moscow has invited the United States to participate as an observer but the US Department of State has yet to confirm Washington will be involved.

READ MORE: Rebels focused on ceasefire at Astana peace talks

Talks are likely to focus on bolstering a shaky ceasefire on the ground after Moscow, Tehran and Ankara agreed to establish a ""mechanism"" aimed at ensuring the truce.

The Geneva negotiations are expected to be wider-ranging, focussing on the key issues that divide the government and rebel sides, including the fate of President Bashar al-Assad.

Russia and Iran have helped turn the tables on the ground with their military backing for Assad, while Turkey has supported rebels fighting to oust the leader."

A rebel official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said on Monday that at most a handful of rebels might attend, but only if progress was seen in the next two days.

Russia had so far failed to yield any tangible steps towards full implementation of the ceasefire, humanitarian aid access, or a release of female detainees the rebels had demanded at the first meeting in the Kazakh capital Astana, he added.

""It seems Russian pressure is of no benefit,"" the official said.

Kazakhstan said on Saturday it had invited the government and rebels for February 15-16 talks. They attended a similar indirect meeting in Astana last month aimed at shoring up a ceasefire brokered by Turkey and Russia, President Bashar al-Assad's most powerful ally.

""The opposition factions will not attend Astana because the Russian side did not abide by what they agreed to before, during and after Astana to uphold the ceasefire agreement,"" Mohammad Al Aboud, a second senior rebel official said.

Russia and Turkey, which backs the rebels, have sought to revive diplomacy towards ending the war since the Syrian government and its backers defeated the rebels in Aleppo in December, their biggest defeat of the conflict.

A new round of UN-backed peace talks are due to begin in Geneva next week.

The Syrian government said earlier on Monday it was ready to agree on prisoner swaps with rebel groups, which the opposition wants before any negotiations over Syria's political future.

Syrian state media cited an official source as saying the government was ""always ready"" to exchange prisoners in its jails for people ""kidnapped by terrorist groups"".

A rebel official dismissed the statement as a ruse, saying Damascus had far more detainees than the few the rebels held.

Geneva Talks

The United Nations special envoy for Syria, Staffan de Mistura, sent invitations on Monday for the Geneva talks beginning on February 23, after initial prior consultations beginning on or about February 20, his spokeswoman Yara Sharif said.

The main Syrian opposition body on Sunday approved its delegation to next week's Geneva talks.

This month, in a rare move, the Syrian government and rebel groups swapped dozens of women prisoners and hostages, some of them with their children, in Hama province in northwestern Syria.

Amnesty International said in a report this month that the government had executed up to 13,000 prisoners in mass hangings at a military jail near Damascus. The Syrian justice ministry called the report ""devoid of truth""."

In a report on Monday, the US-based rights group said it had verified eight chemical attacks during the offensive from November 17 to December 13, adding that four children were among the victims.

HRW said it had interviewed witnesses, collected photos and reviewed video footage to reach the conclusion that chlorine bombs were dropped from government helicopters during the operation.

Around 200 people were wounded by the toxic gases used on opposition-controlled areas of the northern city, according to HRW.

One of the deadliest bombings hit the neighbourhood of Sakhur on November 20, killing six members of the same family, including four children whose lifeless bodies were shown on a video taken by the Shabha press agency.

'Coordinated attacks'

Aleppo, once Syria's bustling commercial hub, had been largely divided between a government-held west and a rebel-controlled east since 2012.

Syrian forces, backed by Russia, launched an offensive in November to seize east Aleppo, a key battleground in Syria's nearly six-year war.

The government of Bashar al-Assad announced on December 22 that it had taken full control of the city.

HRW said its report did not find proof of Russian involvement in the chemical attacks, but noted Moscow's key role in helping the government to retake eastern Aleppo.

READ MORE: Aleppo's heritage sites 'in danger'

The HRW report detailed attacks on a playground, clinics, residential streets and houses that left scores of people struggling to breathe, vomiting and unconscious.

The alleged attacks, which may have involved as many as three helicopters operating jointly, took place in areas where government forces were poised to advance, said the rights group.

""The pattern of the chlorine attacks shows that they were coordinated with the overall military strategy for retaking Aleppo, not the work of a few rogue elements,"" said Ole Solvang, HRW's deputy emergencies director.

'Industrial strength'

Louis Charbonneau, the UN director at HRW, told Al Jazeera that the senior military officials who would have been overseeing the battle for Aleppo had to know chemical weapons were used.

""This is industrial strength. People get a burning in their throats, their eyes tear up. Their lungs fill with fluid. Your body simply will not let you bring in air. You can actually see the yellow-green gas as it is moving through,"" he said, explaining the effects of the gas.

The actual number of chemical attacks could be higher, said the group, adding that journalists, medical personnel and other credible sources had reported at least 12 attacks in that period.

READ MORE: 'No one is safe in east Aleppo'

Chlorine use as a weapon is banned under the Chemical Weapons Convention, which Syria joined in 2013 under pressure from Russia.

The use of chlorine bombs as an indiscriminate weapon could amount to war crimes.

HRW urged the UN Security Council to impose sanctions on senior leaders in the chain of Syrian command, but such a move would likely be vetoed by Russia.

France and Britain are pushing the Security Council to ban the sale of helicopters to Syria and impose the first UN sanctions against Syrian military leaders and entities tied to chemical weapons development.

A joint investigation by the UN and the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons found that several units of the Syrian army had used toxic weapons against three villages in northern Syria in 2014 and 2015.

It was the first time an international probe blamed Assad's forces after years of denial from his government in Damascus."

The government is ""continuously ready"" for such an exchange with rebel groups, ""particularly in the framework of efforts being made for the coming meeting in Astana"", a news flash on the state-run Al Ikhbariya TV station said, citing an official source.

Al Jazeera's Andrew Simmons, reporting from the Turkish city of Gaziantep along the Syrian border, said it was ""difficult to know how significant this is because there have been prisoner swaps in the past"".

Russia, Turkey and Iran - who created a trilateral mechanism to enforce the fragile ceasefire in Syria last month in Astana - are set to meet again in the Kazakh capital later this week.

The Kazakh foreign ministry said over the weekend that the Syrian government and rebel delegations had been invited to attend the meetings, set for February 15-16.

The meetings in Astana were originally aimed at consolidating the truce in Syria, a nationwide halt in the fighting established late in December that has steadily fallen apart over the past month.

The Astana talks were also meant to pave the way towards peace negotiations Geneva, tentatively set to begin on February 20.

""Originally, the thought was this was going to be a final attempt to get the ceasefire really tightened up in advance of the Geneva talks, but now there are suggestions that it could be more than that ... that there is some sort of peace deal on the table that might have legs for Geneva ... [it's] not clear yet,"" said Simmons.

The Syrian government has conducted prisoner exchanges in the past with a wide range of rebel groups under the auspices of the Syrian Red Crescent and the International Committee of the Red Cross.

This month, in a rare move, the Syrian government and rebel groups swapped dozens of female prisoners and hostages, some of them with their children, in Hama province in northwestern Syria.

Syria's main opposition body approved, on Sunday, a new delegation to take part in Geneva talks later this month, which includes Russian-backed blocs that have been critical of the armed insurrection against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.

The High Negotiation Committee (HNC), the main umbrella group, said in a statement after two days of meetings in the Saudi capital, Riyadh, that the new 21-member negotiating team included members of two dissident alliances with which it has previously been at odds.

Those two alliances - the so-called Moscow and Cairo groups - have long disavowed the armed rebellion and insisted that political change can only come through peaceful activism. Their members include a former Syrian government minister with close ties to Moscow.

Mohammad Sabra, who was appointed as chief negotiator, told Saudi-owned Al Hadath news channel that the delegation brought together various groups. He also accused unidentified foreign powers of trying to impose their views on the composition of the delegation, an apparent reference to Russia.

The body also chose a new head of the negotiating team, Nasr al-Hariri, a veteran opposition figure from southern Syria.

The HNC said in the statement the goal of the negotiations was a political transition under UN auspices in which Assad had no role in the future of the country. But it steered away from its previous insistence the Syrian president should leave at the start of a transitional phase.

The HNC also said foreign powers had no right to present a vision of Syria's future political system without the consent of Syrians.

Russia last month tabled the draft of a proposed new constitution for Syria, though it insisted the document had been circulated for the purposes of discussion only.

The HNC represented the opposition in Geneva talks last year, but it was not invited to recently convened talks in the Kazakh capital, Astana.

The indirect talks between government and rebel delegates in Astana were held with the aim of shoring up a ceasefire brokered by Turkey and Russia."

Turkish troops and their Syrian rebel allies had entered the centre of the ISIL bastion Al Bab, Erdogan said on Sunday, adding that its capture was just a ""matter of time"".

""After Al Bab is about to be over, the period following that will be Manbij and Raqqa,"" Erdogan told journalists before his departure on an official visit to Bahrain, Saudi Arabia and Qatar.

""We shared our thoughts with the new US administration and CIA and we will follow the developments in line with our stance,"" he added.

""The ultimate goal is to establish a safe zone by cleansing a 4,000 to 5,000sq km area from the terrorists.""

ISIL, which stands for Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, and is also known as ISIS, captured Raqqa in northern Syria in March 2013.

Erdogan said ISIL fighters had begun deserting Al Bab, but the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said Turkish troops have yet to enter the town's centre.

The UK-based war monitor, which relies on a network of activists inside Syria, said Turkish forces had advanced into Al Bab from the west in recent days, and now controlled around 10 percent of the town and all of its western suburbs.

READ MORE: Syria operations 'will continue until the end', says Erdogan

The Turkish army launched a campaign inside Syria on August 24, codenamed Euphrates Shield, to clean its border from ISIL fighters and stop the advance of Kurdish militia, seen by Turkey as a ""terrorist"" hostile force.

Erdogan said Turkish forces had no intention of staying in Syria once the area had been cleared of both ISIL and Kurdish YPG fighters.

The Turkish-backed opposition forces advancing from the north are racing to seize Al Bab, ISIL's last stronghold in the northern province of Aleppo. before Syrian government forces reach the town from the south.

The Turkish-backed forces are still a long way from Raqqa, which is largely surrounded by US-backed Syrian Kurdish forces.

Last week, the Kurdish-led Syria Democratic Forces launched a new phase in its Raqqa offensive, aiming to capture towns and villages east of the city. The US-led coalition has targeted several bridges across the Euphrates River in support of the operation.

""The potential for further conflict is clear to see, unless some sort of solution has been agreed between Turkey, the US, Russia and the Kurds,"" Al Jazeera's Andrew Simmons, reporting from Gaziantep, on the Turkish side of the Syria-Turkey border, said.

Simmons said a border buffer zone, safe areas and no-fly zones had all been proposed by Turkey in the past, but rejected by the administration of ex-US President Barack Obama.

""Now, have things changed? Has US President Donald Trump agreed to something? It isn't clear at this stage, but Erdogan is insisting that he suggested cities being built in this safe area and refugees coming back from Turkey to be settled in them,"" Simmons said.

The clashes in Al Bab have proved the toughest so far for Turkey's army, with soldier fatalities increasing.

One Turkish soldier was killed and three others wounded in clashes with fighters on Sunday, the private Dogan news agency reported, citing military sources.

The latest casualty raised the number of Turkish troops killed in the Syria offensive to 67.

The three injured troops were evacuated from Al Bab and taken to hospitals in Turkey's Kilis and Gaziantep provinces near the Syrian border, Dogan reported."

Heavy clashes were under way with the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) group on Saturday in Al Bab, 40km south of the Turkish border, which has been besieged since Monday, when government forces advancing from the south cut off a road leading into the town, the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) said.

""Turkish forces and allied rebels in the Euphrates Shield campaign entered the western edge of the town and took control of a number of areas,"" said the SOHR.

The Turkish-backed Ahrar al-Sham group announced on Saturday, on Twitter, that the rebel forces had taken Al Bab's silos and sports complex in its southwestern districts.

The coalition's operations room released a video on social media showing its fighters at the gates of the Hikma hospital.

The Turkish military said in a statement on Saturday that at least 43 ISIL fighters were ""neutralised"" [meaning either killed or captured] in the last 24 hours as part of the operation.

At least 245 ISIL targets, including the group's shelters, headquarters, defence positions and vehicles, were hit by Free Syrian Army (FSA) fighters with Turkish Land Forces' support, the statement said.

It also said Turkish fighter jets destroyed 55 buildings used by ISIL as hideouts, two headquarters, two meeting points, a guard station, an arms depot, and a wireless station.

Turkey began a campaign inside Syria on August 24, attacking both ISIL (also known as ISIS) and Kurdish fighters.

After initial rapid progress, the campaign became mired in the deadly fight for Al Bab since December.

At least 66 Turkish soldiers have been killed in the campaign since it started, mostly in ISIL attacks, according to Turkey's Dogan news agency. Turkey claims to have killed at least 2,705 ISIL members and 344 Kurdish fighters.

Al Bab has been under ISIL control since 2014, when the group seized large expanses of territory in Syria and neighbouring Iraq, proclaiming a caliphate.

On the diplomatic front, President Bashar al-Assad's government and rebel delegations have been invited along with Staffan de Mistura, the UN special envoy for Syria, to meetings in Astana on February 15-16, according to Kazakhstan's foreign ministry.

The talks in the Kazakh capital will discuss the implementation and consolidation of the ceasefire in Syria, the ministry said.

Representatives of Jordan and the US are also invited to the meeting.

The negotiations - brokered by Russia, Iran and Turkey - began last month with the aim of solidifying a broad ceasefire, in effect since late December.

The three countries have mapped out the areas they believe are controlled by the moderate opposition forces included in the truce and the armed groups that are not."

Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin spokesman, said on Friday that ""there should not have been Turkish soldiers within the limits of these coordinates"".

Besides the three fatalities, 11 soldiers were wounded in Thursday's incident, in which Russian forces, trying to target the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) group, hit a building where the troops were deployed, according to the Turkish army.

Russia and Turkey have joined forces against ISIL, also known as ISIS, around Al Bab, where Turkish forces are battling the group on the ground.

Al Bab, 30km south of the Syria-Turkey border, is the last remaining significant ISIL stronghold in Syria's north.

""The situation is obvious, unfortunately. Our military, while launching strikes on terrorists, followed coordinates that were given to us by our Turkish partners,"" Peskov said.

'Communications failure'

Peskov stressed that the ""causes of the incident are clear. There is no debate"".

Asked if this was a mistake by the Turkish intelligence, he said the incident was caused by a communications failure.

The Turkish military said it considered the Russian incident an accident.

But it reiterated on Friday it had given the coordinates of the building to its Russian counterparts on Wednesday.

The Turkish statement said the soldiers had been in the same position for 10 days and that their coordinates had been communicated to Russia's Khmeimim airbase in Syria, and in person to the Russian military attache in Ankara.

SPECIAL SERIES: The boy who started the Syrian war

Russian President Vladimir Putin has expressed condolences in a telephone conversation with Turkish counterpart, Recep Tayyip Erdogan.

The Kremlin said that the two leaders agreed to ""enhance military coordination in the course of the operation in Syria against the Islamic State fighters and other extremist organisations"".

Speaking in the city of Afyon, Numan Kurtulmus, Turkish deputy prime minister, said it was important that Putin had expressed his condolences to Erdogan.

""From our side, the issue is being investigated. Initial information shows this was an accident ... and an undesired incident as a result of incorrect information, coordinates,"" he said.

However, Al Jazeera's Andrew Simmons, reporting from the Turkish border town of Gaziantep, said there appeared to be a dispute about what exactly happened.

""Now, Turkey is saying that they have been in their position with their army for 10 days and they had warned the Russians exactly where they were the day before they were struck,"" he said.

Fighters 'neutralised'

Against this backdrop, at least 23 ISIL fighters were ""neutralised"" in northern Syria by the Turkish military as part of the ongoing Operation Euphrates Shield, the Turkish army said on Friday in a statement carried by the Anadolu news agency.

In addition, Free Syrian Army (FSA), with support from Turkish troops, hit 154 ISIL targets, including shelters, headquarters, defence positions and vehicles, the statement said.

Turkish fighter jets also destroyed seven buildings used as hideouts, three headquarters and an arms depot of the group.

The Turkey-led Operation Euphrates Shield began in late August through FSA fighters backed by Turkish artillery and jets to improve security, support coalition forces and eliminate the threat along the Turkish border.

By contrast, Russia has been waging a bombing campaign in Syria in support of the forces of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad since 2015.

In yet another development on Friday, Syrian government forces and their allies in the Lebanese Shia Hezbollah group drew closer to Al Bab, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR).

According to the Britain-based SOHR, government forces made ""an important and strategic advance by taking the village of Abu Taltal"" in the southern sector of Al Bab.

""The regime forces are now 1.5km from Al Bab city,"" the SOHR said."
31,https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2017/02/trump-iran-scenarios-escalation-170209092314262.html,Trump and Iran: Scenarios of escalation,"Iran and the new Trump administration have already clashed with potentially disastrous consequences. The extreme vulnerability of the rapport between the two countries following the nuclear deal was on show recently as Iran tested a new long-range missile, and the Washington put Iran ""on notice"".

Yet, it is unsurprising that after 35 years of enmity, the revived US-Iran relationship would stumble as a radically different leadership takes power in Washington. Indeed, it might fall further should a similar shift occur in May after presidential elections take place in Iran. Does this mean the nuclear deal is doomed? It may be. But if so, it would be as much by default as by design. Four unexpected consequences of ill-conceived moves on Washington's part could intensify the conflict and collapse the deal. One smart move could save it.

The pitfalls

1) Misreading Iran's bluster as more than an 'opening position'

The legality of the missile launch within the terms of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), the nuclear agreement signed in 2015 by both governments, has drawn much speculation by American analysts, but no actual determination that it broke the letter of the law.

The Trump administration's inexperience in reading the tea leaves of Iran's foreign policy manoeuvres, however, has led it to decide, that, legal or not, the launch was an insult and a threat. So it hurled back a threat of its own.

Yet - much like Trump himself - the Islamic Republic is a prodder and doesn't back down when it gets a reaction. The result: public denunciations and shows of power will likely escalate.

2) Viewing diplomacy with Iran as useless, assuming that all it understands is force

To Trita Parsi, of the American Iranian Council (whose forthcoming book tells the inside story on how exactly the deal was done), to put shouty cards on the table without a soft-exit plan is to misunderstand the game of diplomacy, particularly when it comes to Iran.

What the Iranians do is play multiple hands - the public stage, the back-corridors, the phone lines - which Trump's predecessors did too. If the new administration only grandstands and doesn't balance tough words with secret meetings and smart compromises that suit both countries, the relationship will crash.

3) Mistaking Iran for a failed state

By placing it on the ""List of Seven"", Trump has put Iran in strange company. The other six are either at war, or lacking central government authority - unlike Iran, which has conducted high-level, government-backed international negotiations with the US over a significant security deal.

This is shaming for Iran, just as it was when George W Bush inducted Iran into the Axis of Evil after it publicly offered to materially support Washington's plans against al-Qaeda after 9/11.

READ MORE: Ayatollah Khamenei - Donald Trump shows real face of US

As previous Iran nuclear negotiator Seyed Moussavian has frequently pointed out, Iran craves international respect, which once it felt forthcoming from Washington, contributed to the miraculous nuclear turnaround.

Trump, by including Iran among the seven Muslim-majority countries whose citizens he tried to ban from entering the US, has signalled that no matter what it does to burnish its international image, Iran will never get US respect. From that perspective, why would he care that not a single Iranian has been apprehended for terrorism inside the US? Misreading an adversary - or a friend - suggests the honeymoon is over.

4) Imagining Iran as having no good options

Iran today - post nuclear deal, free of UN and EU sanctions, restored as a regional power balancing Turkey and Saudi Arabia in Syria, and, critically, close to Russia - is not the lonely pariah of the past.

To completely misjudge Iran, and allow the relationship of jabs and one-upmanship to deteriorate to a point where the use of force is the only option left on the table, would see the US going into war largely alone.

Its economy is big - it's the second largest producer of both steel and cars in the Middle East. But its trade goes not west but east, to the booming markets of China and India, and north, to Russia. A report this week by the conservative Washington Institute of Near East Studies noted that Iran's tight relationship with Moscow defies history, but reflects a solid pragmatism on both parts, that will be unfazed by Trump officials threatening to drive a wedge between them.

US administrations have consistently underestimated Iran's ability to survive international pressure, such as the travel bans and individual targets in Congress's newest ""behavioural modification"" sanctions passed last week.

Today, however, miscalibrating Iran's regional clout could damage the US' relations with both Moscow and Ankara, each of which have recently been wobbly and such a miscalculation could seriously compromise American regional plans to contain the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL).

To completely misjudge Iran, and allow the relationship of jabs and one-upmanship to deteriorate to a point where the use of force is the only option left on the table, would see the US going into war largely alone.

Though Israel might be at its side (and the already war-worn Saudi Arabia), Russia, supportive of Iran's recent ""legal"" missile test, would not sit back idly, but demand booty and threaten the use of force in equal measure. Islamists, all supporters of al-Qaeda, Jabhat Fateh al-Sham, ISIL or the Khorasan Group, would finally have their turn against the US as Donald Trump stumbles back into the morass from which President Barack Obama had withdrawn.

And the Europeans cannot be counted on. The European Union just re-iterated Iran's compliance with the JPCOA once again, signalling that it does not share Trump's view of Tehran's misdemeanours.

Yet all this could be avoided with one smart move. And one that fits with President Trump's own self-image as a deal-maker.

The solution

Offer a White Flag, and recast Iran as a valuable prospective market.

Hardliners and reformers in Iran agree on little, and neither would find much in common with Trump today, except to agree that the JCPOA isn't working well - currency regimes have been inadequately loosened, sanctions haven't been sufficiently lifted, companies are hesitant to sign deals, and international bank engagement remains anaemic.

For either side, destroying the JCPOA would not be difficult. But presidential greatness stems not from ripping up deals but, as Jimmy Carter with the Camp David Accords and Obama with Cuba both illustrated, it comes from making them work. By approaching Iran in a completely new way (as Richard Nixon did with China) and turning it into an economic opportunity for US companies - currently restricted from doing any business, no matter how lucrative, with oil-soaked Iran - it could be both a diplomatic, and a commercial coup for the new president.

Sadly, that's the last thing that Mr Trump would think of doing.

The advance threatens an important ISIL stronghold, whose fall would deepen Turkish influence in an area of northern Syria where it has created a de facto buffer zone.

The Turkish military said in a statement that 58 ISIL fighters had been killed in air raids, artillery fire, and clashes. Two Turkish soldiers were killed and 15 slightly wounded.

Syrian government forces also advanced on al-Bab from the south on Wednesday, bringing them into close proximity with their Turkish and rebel enemies in one of the most complex battlefields of the six-year-old conflict.

But Turkey said international coordination was under way to prevent clashes with the Syrian forces.

""The al-Bab operation must be completed immediately in the period ahead ... In recent days our special forces and the Free Syrian Army [rebels] have made serious progress,"" Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu told a news conference.

In a sign of Turkish momentum and confidence, the government said its next target would be the Syrian city of Raqqa, de facto capital of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant group, which is also under attack in its Iraqi stronghold of Mosul.

Al-Bab has been a major target of a Turkish offensive launched in northern Syria last August to drive ISIL away from the border and prevent further gains by US-backed Kurdish militia that are also fighting the group. The city is just 30km from the Turkish border.

A Free Syrian Army rebel commander, speaking to the Reuters news agency from the southeastern outskirts of al-Bab, said Syrian government jets and helicopters were visible to the west of his position, adding there was now an ""indirect frontline"" between the sides.

But an official in a military alliance backing Syrian President Bashar al-Assad said the city was being left to Turkish control, in what appeared to be part of a deal with Russia, Assad's most powerful ally.

Turkish Prime Minister Binali Yildirim said clashes with the Syrian forces had been avoided.

""As a result of coordination between coalition forces, the Turkish air force and Russia, necessary measures are being taken to prevent any unpleasant incidents or clashes,"" Yildirim said.

Assad has been backed in the war by the Russian air force and an array of Iranian-backed Shi'ite militias. The Syrian army advance towards al-Bab is aimed at preventing deeper Turkish advances and safeguarding the city of Aleppo, 50km to the southwest.

'Progress is fast'

A Syrian rebel fighter reached by Reuters said he was speaking from inside al-Bab where ISIL lines were ""collapsing"".

""Praise God, the progress is fast,"" he said. ""The operation is continuing.""

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based organisation that uses a network of contacts in Syria to monitor the war, said it was not yet clear if ISIL was on the ropes. It said at least six people had been killed and 12 more wounded in the latest shelling there.

ISIL is being fought by three separate military alliances in northern Syria, including the US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces, which incorporate the Kurdish YPG militia.

US support for the YPG has angered Turkey, which views it as an extension of a Kurdish militia that is waging a rebellion in Turkey.

Turkish sources said President Tayyip Erdogan and US President Donald Trump agreed in a phone call overnight to act jointly against ISIL in al-Bab and Raqqa.

The White House said in a statement that Trump spoke about the two countries' ""shared commitment to combating terrorism in all its forms""."

A pro-government media outlet said Syrian planes targeted rebels in al-Waer neighbourhood after the fighters fired at civilian areas in government-held Homs.

Al-Waer has for months been spared the intense bombardment by Syrian and Russian air forces suffered by other areas including Idlib province, controlled by President Bashar al-Assad's opponents.

The British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) said at least eight people were killed in the government bombardment.

The Syrian Civil Defence, a rescue service operating in rebel-held territory, did not give a figure, but said on its Facebook page that its centre in al-Waer was hit, wounding a staff member, and that there were fatalities elsewhere including women and children.

An opposition media activist in al-Waer, who gave his name as Osama Abu-Zeid, said that it had been months since the last significant bombardment of the area.

""Yesterday it suddenly escalated,"" he told Reuters news agency.

A military media unit run by Assad's Lebanese ally, Hezbollah, said the army had fired rockets and that planes had carried out three strikes against rebels in al-Waer, who it said had violated a shaky ceasefire across parts of western Syria.

The SOHR reported at least one person wounded by rockets that landed in the government-controlled Abbasiya neighbourhood in Homs.

The Syrian government has tried to conclude a deal in al-Waer that would see rebel fighters and their families evacuate the district and the government take over.

Under similar local agreements in other parts of western Syria, rebels have left with light weapons and headed mostly for Idlib.

Assad said on Wednesday that local reconciliation agreements were the ""most effective way to end the war and move towards a political solution"", state news agency SANA reported.

Government strategy

The opposition says such agreements are part of a government strategy to forcibly displace populations from opposition-held areas after years of siege and bombardment.

In September, some 120 opposition fighters and their families left al-Waer in agreement with the government, but there have been no further reports of rebels leaving the area.

The SOHR estimates several thousand rebels remain in the district.

The ceasefire brokered by Russia, which backs Assad, and Turkey, which supports rebels fighting to unseat him, took effect on December 30.

It has been fragile since the start, with the government side and rebels accusing the other of violations. The truce does not include the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) group or al-Qaeda-linked fighters.

On Wednesday, shells fired by rebels into Aleppo city in northern Syria killed at least two people, SANA reported.

The Syrian Red Crescent said four of its volunteers were wounded, one critically, as they distributed aid in the Hamdaniya district.

Government forces drove rebels from their last remaining districts in Aleppo in December in a major victory for Assad. Shell fire has hit the city on several occasions since then.

Also on Wednesday, the Turkish news agency Anadolu reported that two Turkish soldiers died in a battle with ISIL, also known as ISIS, in northern Syria, citing the Turkish military.

ISIL fighters 'neutralised'

The Turkish general staff had earlier confirmed that two other Turkish soldiers had been killed and 58 ISIL fighters ""neutralised"" during Operation Euphrates Shield.

Turkish authorities use the word ""neutralised"", meaning either surrendered, captured or killed.

An operation was launched late on Tuesday to take control of Al-Bab. As a result of the operation, Free Syrian Army fighters supported by the Turkish military seized a number of strategic hills, the Turkish general staff statement said.

Operation Euphrates Shield began in late August 2016."

ISIL fighters in the area are now effectively surrounded by the Syrian army from the south and by Turkish-backed rebels from the north, as Damascus and Ankara race to capture the largest stronghold of the armed group in Aleppo province, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said on Monday.

The British-based war monitor, which tracks developments in Syria's conflict, added that the army and allied militia had made gains southeast of al-Bab overnight and fought ISIL there on Monday.

Backed by air strikes, they severed a road that links the city to other ISIL-held territory in Raqqa and Deir Az Zor provinces, it said.

A military commander in the alliance fighting in support of President Bashar al-Assad said ISIL, which stands for Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant and is also known as ISIS, was now encircled.

""There is one narrow passage left out of al-Bab,"" the commander told the Reuters news agency. Government forces now had most of it ""within close firing range"", he said.

Key city

The Syrian army's advance towards al-Bab risks triggering a confrontation with the Turkish military and its allies - rebel groups fighting under the Free Syria Army (FSA) banner - which have been waging their own campaign to take the city.

In three weeks, Syrian army units moved to within 6km of al-Bab, as Damascus seeks to stop Turkey from penetrating deeper into a strategic area of northern Syria.

READ MORE: Russian and Turkish jets 'bomb ISIL' in Syria's Al Bab

""It's clear the regime is in a hurry to reach al-Bab,"" Mustafa Sejari, a senior rebel official in the FSA group Liwa al-Mutasem, told Reuters. The Turkish-backed rebels, who have also had the city in their sights for months, would fight government forces if they got in the way, he said.

Turkey launched its campaign in Syria, ""Euphrates Shield"", in August to secure its frontier from ISIL and halt the advance of the powerful Kurdish YPG militia.

Backed by Turkey's air force, Turkish troops and FSA rebels on Monday clashed with ISIL fighters around the town of Bazaa, northeast of al-Bab, the Observatory said. Turkish-backed forces had briefly captured the town before suicide bombers pushed them out on Saturday.

Al-Bab is 40km northeast of Aleppo, where the government defeated rebels in December - its most important gain in the nearly six-year-old war.

Northern Syria is one of the most complicated battlefields of the multi-sided Syrian war, with ISIL now being fought there by the Syrian army, Turkey and its rebel allies, and an alliance of US-backed Syrian militias.

If a clash does occur, it would be the first time Syrian government forces have confronted the Turkish army on the ground in northern Syria since Turkey launched its operation.

OPINION: Operation Euphrates Shield - Progress and scope

Russia, Assad's most powerful ally, has carried out air strikes targeting ISIL in the al-Bab area in support of both sides, underlining big shifts in the diplomatic landscape.

As relations between Russia and Turkey have improved, the two countries brokered a shaky ceasefire in December between the Syrian government and rebel groups fighting to unseat Assad.

An official from one of the Turkmen rebel brigades backed by Turkey said the presence of Russian forces could help prevent a confrontation.

""There are Russian soldiers along with the regime forces who are leading the way and that is an element that could satisfy Turkey,"" the rebel official told Reuters. ""I don't expect clashes."""

The meeting comes two weeks after the three countries reached an agreement in Astana to create a trilateral mechanism aimed at monitoring breaches of a fragile truce established in late December and paving the way towards UN-led peace talks in February.

Representatives of Jordan are also expected to take part in Monday's meeting.

The agenda for the meeting, according to a spokesperson for Kazakhstan's foreign ministry, includes a review of the ceasefire implementation, and a discussion of a proposal submitted from the Syrian armed opposition about the truce.

""This is about creating a mechanism to control the implementation of the ceasefire,"" the ministry spokesman said.

The parties also plan to discuss cooperation on humanitarian issues and increasing levels of trust between the Syrian government and the opposition.

The Kazakh foreign ministry gave no information about the line-up of the delegations, who were meeting behind closed doors.

Talks last month in Astana brought together representatives of the Syrian government and armed opposition groups for the first time since the beginning of the Syrian war in 2011.

The two-day Astana talks, organised by Russia and Turkey, came as Moscow takes the diplomatic lead in the war after its 2015 military intervention helped turn the tides of the conflict in favour of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.

Before the meetings began, observers expected to see the first face-to-face negotiations between the government and representatives of the armed opposition since the war began, but rebels refused to participate in direct talks over ceasefire violations.

OPINION: The FSA's demands ahead of Geneva

The Russian delegation spent the two days shuttling between meetings with the Syrian government, the Iranian delegation - one of the Syrian government's strongest allies, the opposition, and Turkey - a key backer of rebel groups operating in the country.

The talks marked the beginning of the latest diplomatic initiative to put an end to nearly six years of war which have left much of the country in ruins, killed nearly half a million people, and displaced half of the population.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said on Sunday the Astana talks were a ""breakthrough step"" in efforts to resolve the crisis but were not intended to be a substitute for UN-led talks.

""We are not planning to replace Geneva with the Astana format,"" he said in an interview published on the ministry's website.

Deep divisions

The talks spotlighted sharp differences between Moscow and Tehran over the possible future participation of the United States and also excluded Gulf states, both major backers of armed opposition groups in Syria.

Iran, whose relations with Washington have nosedived since Donald Trump assumed the presidency, opposes any US involvement.

Lavrov reiterated on Sunday that the US and Moscow were in a position to solve bilateral issues, improve ties and coordinate efforts to fight ""international terrorism"", but said it had to be on the basis of mutual respect.

The secretary of Iran's Supreme National Security Council, Ali Shamkhani, also praised the Astana talks in a meeting with Russia's special envoy on Syria, Alexander Lavrentiev, in Tehran on Sunday, according to the Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA).

But he said peace was not achievable with certain groups still active on the ground - specifically the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), and Jabhat Fateh al-Sham, known as al-Nusra Front before officially cutting ties with al-Qaeda.

""As long as Daesh [ISIL] and al-Nusra and groups linked to them are present in Syria - and they are being protected and supported by some countries in the region - a political solution and peace for Syria and the region will not be achievable.""

The Syrian opposition have objected to Iran's role in the Astana talks, blaming Shia militias backed by Tehran for violations of the fragile ceasefire agreement by launching military assaults in rebel-held suburbs of the capital.

UN special envoy Staffan de Mistura said the UN would attend a follow-up technical meeting in Astana on February 6 to further discuss the implementation and monitoring of the ceasefire."
38,https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2017/02/fsa-demands-geneva-170204115507362.html,The FSA's demands ahead of Geneva,"The Astana talks were an opportunity for Syrian rebel groups to lead negotiations focused solely on implementing the ceasefire. Previous rounds of peace talks have failed due to the clear lack of commitment by Bashar al-Assad and his backers to a sustainable ceasefire, unimpeded humanitarian access, and a solution to the plight of detainees.

While the position of the regime has not changed, the political and armed opposition are prepared to negotiate an end to the bloodshed and a genuine political solution. The Free Syrian Army (FSA) agreed to participate in Astana on the basis of Turkey's role as a guarantor, and to test Russia's readiness to apply real pressure on the Assad regime and Iran to commit to a sustainable ceasefire. We are yet to see any clear sign that either is prepared to negotiate in good faith.

If Russia genuinely wants to see concrete outcomes from Astana, there must be real progress towards an enforced nationwide ceasefire with independent monitors as part of a UN-led mechanism. Securing this would be a critical first step towards enabling a genuine discussion over a political transition in Geneva in the coming weeks.

The Astana talks

Russia used the brutal destruction and fall of Aleppo, in which it played a central role, to push for talks. The FSA and other armed groups agreed to a truce on December 26, in the interest of halting the bloodshed and protecting civilians.

The armed factions agreed to attend the Astana talks in accordance with an agreement reached in Ankara alongside the ceasefire. This agreement states that a direct discussion with Assad's regime should take place and provided clear and credible Russian guarantees that the regime will commit to what was signed in Ankara.

US President Donald Trump's willingness to enforce safe zones is a potentially positive step towards protecting civilians and creating some real pressure on Russia to take seriously the need for a political solution, but this will only work if the safe zones are properly enforced and protected.

The delegates who attended the Astana talks were selected from a broad spectrum of rebel factions which signed the Ankara agreement; the majority of these individuals are officers and political representatives of the FSA. The talks also highlighted the critical coordination between the armed groups and political opposition in the shape of the Syrian High Negotiations Committee.

The delegation's agenda in Astana was clear: proposing and discussing credible steps for implementing a comprehensive, enforced ceasefire in order to stop the bloodshed.

Our agreement to talks with the regime is not an acceptance of their position. Nothing has changed from our perspective, the Assad regime is guilty of the vast majority of civilians killed in Syria since 2011, and continues to systematically detain, torture, displace and starve hundreds of thousands of Syrians.

While the FSA and other moderate rebel groups continue to lead the fight against ISIL, the Assad regime, with the full backing of Iran and Russia, focused their military efforts on besieging and bombarding areas with no ISIL presence at all, such as eastern Aleppo and Wadi Barada. The way forward remains clear: Assad can have no place in Syria's future as a democratic free Syria, governed by the rule of law and genuine justice.

The regime and its allied foreign militias violated the December ceasefire almost immediately by launching a military campaign on the town of Wadi Barada. Since the start of this campaign, the regime and its militias have violated the ceasefire on an almost daily basis, killing and injuring hundreds of civilians, with complete impunity.

During the talks in Astana, the head of the regime delegation, Bashar Jaafari, confirmed publicly that this brutal offensive and siege would continue. It is clear that Russia is either unable or unwilling to put serious pressure on the regime. If there is any hope of ending the bloodshed, this must change.

Implementing the ceasefire

The tripartite agreement between Russia, Turkey and Iran is not enough.

To secure a sustainable, credible ceasefire in Syria, there must be an effective and independent UN-led monitoring mechanism and clear consequences for those who violate it. In Astana, we set out a detailed proposal on the requirements for a sustainable ceasefire, including international observers inside Syria. The reality is those who have committed war crimes in Syria and continue to back Assad's murderous regime, namely Iran and Russia, cannot be trusted to credibly monitor and enforce a genuine ceasefire.

US President Donald Trump's willingness to enforce safe zones is potentially a positive step towards protecting civilians and creating some real pressure on Russia to take the need for a political solution seriously, but this will only work if the safe zones are properly enforced and protected.

The armed group's Astana delegation made their position clear: discussions on a political transition and Syria's future must take place in Geneva under UN supervision. In parallel, the opposition's participation in Geneva must be through the High Negotiations Committee, representing a broad spectrum of political and armed groups, including the FSA.

Successful outcomes from Astana, or any other venue through which discussions on a ceasefire take place, will be critical to paving the way to genuine negotiations on a political solution in Geneva.

Representatives of the Syrian government and opposition on Monday traded barbs over interpretations of a ceasefire brokered by Russia and Turkey in late December, as their respective regional backers met behind closed doors to keep the meeting on track.

The meeting in Astana, organised by Russia and Turkey, is aimed at strengthening a nationwide ceasefire that has largely held despite pockets of violence across the country, and paving the way towards UN-led political negotiations in Geneva on February 8.

The talks mark the first time the Syrian opposition is represented solely by representatives of armed groups.

READ MORE: Rebels focused on ceasefire at Astana peace talks

Bashar al-Jaafari, head of the Syrian government delegation, accused the opposition of ""misinterpreting"" the tenets of the ceasefire, saying the ""provocative tone and lack of seriousness in the opposition delegation chief's speech"" had ""irritated the attendees' diplomatic senses and experience"".

Referring to the rebel delegation as ""terrorists"", Jaafari said opposition groups who signed the truce deal were ""trying to undermine and sabotage the Astana meetings"".

Opposition leader Yahya al-Aridi complained that the Syrian government had not demonstrated serious commitment to the ceasefire, which came into effect on December 30, arguing there should be ""clarity"" before direct negotiations.

""If there is seriousness in making these talks lead to something substantial, formality won't be that important,"" Aridi told Al Jazeera.

But as delegates exited closed-door talks to trade jabs via duelling press conferences, the crux of the meeting may have been happening elsewhere.

Noah Bonsey, a Syria analyst with the International Crisis Group, said any potential ""impact"" from the Astana talks is ""more likely to come as a result of the trilateral talks between Iran, Turkey and Russia than it is from any direct exchanges between the Syrian delegations.

READ MORE: Syria's civil war explained

""We're sitting on the sidelines of talks meant to be between the Syrian government and the opposition, but the main event is what is happening in the trilateral talks,"" he told Al Jazeera.

""Between Turkey, Russia and Iran you have tremendous leverage and military weight on the ground in Syria. If they make progress in adjusting the ceasefire that has already been agreed ... that could have major military ramifications.""

Russia, whose 2015 military intervention was crucial in turning the tide in favour of the government, and Turkey, a prominent backer of the opposition, were key forces in establishing the ceasefire and bringing the opposing sides to Astana.

But diplomatic sources close to the opposition told Al Jazeera that the role of Iran, a key ally of the government in Damascus and backer of thousands of allied militia forces on the ground, has been problematic for the rebels within the talks.

The rebel delegation was reportedly hesitant to be seen sitting at the same table as the Iranian delegation and was angry that Iran could be named as the third guarantor - in addition to Russia and Turkey - in strengthening the ceasefire.

In separate press statements, officials from both sides made contrasting claims over whether Jabhat Fateh al-Sham, a group previously linked to al-Qaeda, is present in Wadi Barada.

The strategic area in rural Damascus is home to the capital's main water source. Recent violence there has threatened the fragile truce.

The ceasefire agreement stipulated that a truce would be implemented across all of Syria, excluding the parts of the country where Jabhat Fateh al-Sham and the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL, also known as ISIS) are operating.

After the first round of talks on Monday, Jaafari said that the government's recent advances in Wadi Barada were aimed at driving out Jabhat Fateh al-Sham from the area, blaming the group for cutting water supplies to 5.5 million Syrians in Damascus since late December.

'Not present'

Rebel representatives in Astana refuted those claims, saying that government bombardment in the area was responsible for disrupting the water supply to the capital.

""Jabhat Fateh al-Sham are not present in Wadi Barada. We asked the Russians to go and see for themselves,"" Fares Bayoush, a Free Syrian Army commander, told a group of reporters.

WATCH: Are the Astana talks a turning point to end Syria's war?

""We have evidence of the rockets which are still there ... These were Syrian rockets,"" he said.

But rebel leaders also said they ""refused to look into the issue of Jabhat Fateh al-Sham until Syria had been emptied of all foreign fighters"", referring to Iranian, Iraqi and Afghan groups fighting on behalf of the government - a demand not previously publicly mentioned as being within the provisions of the truce deal."

The meetings in Astana, organised by Russia and Turkey, are aimed at strengthening a shaky ceasefire that has largely held despite incidents of violence across Syria.

Opposition spokesman Yahya al-Aridi said the rebels had backed out of the first session of face-to-face negotiations on Monday, accusing the government of Bashar al-Assad of violating the December 30 truce deal brokered by Russia and Turkey.

""If there is seriousness in making these talks lead to something substantial, formality won't be that important,"" Aridi told Al Jazeera.

READ MORE: Rebels focused on ceasefire at Astana peace talks

""We haven't seen any signs of commitment to the ceasefire; there should be clarity and agreement on this first.""

But Bashar al-Jaafari, the head of the Syrian government delegation, also accused rebels of not keeping their end in the ceasefire deal - particularly in Wadi Barada, a strategic area in the Damascus suburbs and home to a major water facility.

Speaking to reporters in Astana, Jaafari repeatedly referred to the rebel delegation as representatives of ""terrorist armed groups"" and said the agenda for the talks is ""not ready yet"".

Al Jazeera's Mohammed Jamjoom, reporting from Astana, described the start of the talks as ""rocky"", saying the lack of direct negotiations raised concerns about the effectiveness of the meeting.

""It is making diplomatic sources wonder how effective these talks will be, because these meetings really hinged on the idea that the rebels and government representatives will meet face-to-face,"" Jamjoom said.

""At this stage, there is a lot of concern behind scenes about how these talks will go.""

Organisers have played down expectations of a breakthrough, with Numan Kurtulmus, Turkey's deputy prime minister, saying the prospect of an immediate solution was still distant.

""There are parties that have been at war with each other for six years around the table at Astana,"" he told journalists on Monday.

""A solution in one or two days should not be expected.""

The negotiations in Kazakhstan, which are expected be over by midday on Tuesday, are likely to be followed by United Nations-mediated diplomatic talks in Geneva, Switzerland, on February 8.

""The talks in Astana are not an alternative to the Geneva talks next month, but are an additional step,"" Roman Vassilenko, the Kazakh deputy foreign minister, said.

Ceasefire, aid

The December 30 truce has largely been holding, despite pockets of violence, specifically in the suburbs of the capital Damascus, where Syrian government forces have been advancing to retake strategic areas.

Before the talks, Jaafari had played down Turkey's role as a party to the talks and said the agenda would focus on strengthening last month's truce.

""Turkey is violating Syrian sovereignty, so there is no Syrian-Turkish dialogue,"" he said, a reference to Turkish support for anti-Assad armed groups in the north of Syria.

READ MORE: In Astana, Russia is 'in full charge'

Syrian opposition officials also said they were focused on securing the current ceasefire, as well as getting humanitarian aid to people living under siege.

""The besieged areas should be relieved from the torture,"" Aridi told Al Jazeera on Monday.

""Aid should reach these besieged areas and the principle of kneel or starve to death should also be humanely removed.""

When asked whether the rebels would sign an agreement to continue negotiations in February's meeting in Geneva, Aridi replied: ""It depends on the productivity and fruitfulness of these [Astana] talks. If they are quite successful, there could come a product, a political one, that could be used in the Geneva talks.""

Although Ankara and Moscow have backed opposing sides of Syria's nearly six-year conflict, they have worked hand-in-hand in recent weeks to try to secure an end to the war.

The US Trump administration was invited to participate in the talks, but did not send a delegation.

Washington will instead be represented by its ambassador to Kazakhstan, according to the US state department.

Staffan de Mistura, the United Nations special envoy for Syria, will also be attending the talks to play a supportive role.

UN envoy for Syria, Staffan de Mistura, on Sunday hailed the talks as a ""good initiative"", in comments carried by Russian news agencies.

France and Britain will also be represented at the ambassador level, according to a European diplomatic source.

Hundreds of thousands of Syrians have been killed during the war, which initially started when largely unarmed anti-government uprisings against Assad erupted in 2011.

More than 12 million people, approximately half of the country's prewar population, have also been displaced over the course of the war.

""No one has discussed this [the future of Assad],"" Yahya al-Aridi, spokesman for the opposition delegation and adviser to the High Negotiations Committee (HNC) told Al Jazeera on Sunday.

Assad was still a ""red line"" for the opposition, he explained, adding that there was ""no context"" for discussing the president's role after a potential political solution.

""[Keeping Assad] is the best prescription for the continuation of the tragedy. If he is capable of carrying on his shoulders the death of half a million people and the displacement of half of the population […] then he can stay. But in reality, things do not work this way,"" Aridi said.

Two-day negotiations are set to begin on Monday.

Officials say meetings will be aimed at consolidating the nationwide ceasefire that went into effect last month.

""At this stage, we have one goal, which has been agreed upon by all the parties included. That is to consolidate the ceasefire. That is why we came here,"" Osama Abu Zaid, spokesman for the Free Syrian Army, one of the rebel groups fighting Assad's government, told Al Jazeera.

He added that his delegation had met Turkish officials on Sunday to discuss the agenda of the talks.

A ceasefire which went into effect on December 30 has largely been holding, despite pockets of violence namely in the suburbs of the capital Damascus, where Syrian government forces have been advancing to retake strategic areas.

Representatives from Moscow and Ankara will be leading the negotiations with the support of Iranian diplomats.

READ MORE: Syria talks set to begin in Astana as ceasefire holds

Earlier this month, Assad declared that his government was ready to negotiate ""on everything"" during the Astana meetings.

Yet, the president's future has been one of the main sticking points that have led to the failure of previous efforts to end close to six years of war in Syria.

'Opposition to compromise'

Since Russia's military intervention in September 2015, the opposition has faced major setbacks, in particular, the defeat in east Aleppo in December.

Analysts say the rebels no longer have the leverage to shape the peace talks.

""The political opposition will be the first to offer compromises, since they are the ones who were driven away and marginalised,"" Mohamed Alahmad, a professor at Georgetown University's Center for Contemporary Arab Studies, told Al Jazeera.

Aridi said as well as attempting to consolidate the ceasefire, rebels wanted to secure the release of prisoners held by the Assad government, lift blockades on besieged areas and ensure civilian access to humanitarian aid.

Speaking to a group of reporters, Aridi would not confirm or deny whether there would be direct negotiations between the Syrian opposition and the government in Damascus.

During last year's UN-backed peace talks in Geneva, the Syrian government refused to engage in direct negotiations with the opposition, whom it calls ""terrorists"".

The Astana meetings are expected to be followed by UN-mediated diplomatic talks in Geneva on February 8.

""There is a Geneva track where they could talk about these things [Assad's future] in detail, where there will be some political transition with full power to the welfare of the people again, to bring Syria back to life,"" said Aridi.

Hundreds of thousands of Syrians have been killed during the war, which initially started when largely unarmed anti-government uprisings against Assad erupted in 2011.

More than 12 million people, approximately half of the country's prewar population, have also been displaced over the course of the war.

57,https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2017/01/human-rights-obama-trump-170122073159463.html,Human rights: From Obama to Trump,"Barack Obama won the White House in 2008 in good measure on the promise of systematic change, not just to rescue an American economy in the throes of the Great Recession, but in a strategic theatre defined by unjustified wars, torture and other violations of international law and norms.

For the global human rights community, there was anticipation that the new administration would work to restore the most egregious violations of US international legal obligations and hold to account the perpetrators of human rights violations.

Despite the hope generated by his famous 2009 Cairo speech promising ""a new beginning"" to America's relationship with the Muslim world, Obama's presidency was marked by banality and continuity rather than change.

Not only did his administration refuse to hold anyone accountable for the unconscionable violations of the Bush years, it continued, and even ramped up, many of its policies.

Human rights under Obama

The lowlights of his administration's actions on human rights include: the large scale use of drone strikes outside active war zones; support or muted criticisms of repressive regimes across the Middle East and North Africa - and beyond; sale or supply of far more weapons than any administration since World War II; favouring the ""stability"" of authoritarian regimes to the uncertainty of ""Islamic"" or other political movements; unwavering support for Israel; ongoing use of massive surveillance programmes that encourage similar activities by authoritarian regimes against their citizens; failure to close Guantanamo Bay; and a complete lack of leadership on the unprecedented refugee crises across Africa, Europe and the Middle East.

Together these policies represent the many smaller banalities of evil that collectively make nightmares such as Syria not only possible, but inevitable.

At best, Obama can be said to have engaged in a ""some truth but no accountability"" strategy about our recent past, and continuity despite profound ethical implications when it comes to the present, thus ensuring we cannot ""look forward rather than back"" precisely because we're continuing too many past policies rather than learning from and changing them.

INTERACTIVE: What has each president left for their successor?

The actions of his administration reinforced rather than challenged the view that US engagement with human rights over the past eight years has been shaped by American amorality and realpolitik rather than the promotion of universally shared values and norms and the clear mandates of international law .

The failure of Obama to adopt pro-human rights policies, domestically or abroad, must be understood as part of a larger political resurfacing of international law, where rhetoric might be given a shiny new gloss while policies remain largely the same.

Against this backdrop, it is hard not to think that the international human rights instruments, codified by the so-called liberal world order during the past century and a half, have always been in good measure little more than a charade, relying on enforcement through the morality of states that have displayed little of it to spare. The 1899 and 1907 Hague Conventions did not prevent the horrors of World War I or World War II, and the myriad of international human rights instruments have, similarly, failed to protect the human rights of billions of people around the world.

Yet despite all its failings and acknowledged limitations, international humanitarian and human rights regimes have standards against which actions can be measured.

Their failings have been less about the ""idea"" that there should be a set of rights to which all persons are entitled, than about the political arena within which these rights must be realised and, when necessary, enforced. In that regard, who governs matters greatly, because states are both the violators and ultimate guarantors of rights.

Particularly in the context of the United Nations, the International Court of Justice, and International Criminal Court and similar tribunals, the world's most powerful states, as represented by the permanent Security Council members - the US, Russia, China, the UK and France, have unmatched power to shape a world order in which respect or violation of human rights is normative.

The process of virtually dismantling the international legal machinery had already begun under the Bush administration. The ""ticking bomb scenario"" and the process of excepting more people from the protections of what are supposed to be universal human rights were planted in the public mindset. Obama corrected its misalignment to some degree, but his policies ultimately have helped re-orient people's views further from, rather than closer to, the core norms and values of human rights.

In most areas, rather than setting an example, President Obama largely continued the abrogation of responsibility the US' paramount position in the international order has placed upon it; a position sadly shared by the other Security Council members.

The least he did was leave the architecture and foundations of the system in place.

Human rights under Trump

Could Trump broadly dismantle the international human rights regime, both at home and abroad? Certainly if his public statements regarding torture, Guantanamo, immigration, refugees, women's rights, healthcare and freedom of the press map on to an administration policy, there is much to worry about.

And it is here, in the public square, where Trump's assault on how we understand the normative values and principles of human rights will pose the greatest threat.

The concept of human rights that has animated international law and activism for the past two centuries will be ill-suited to function in a thoroughly illiberal age, where entire religions, ethnicities and countries exist more or less in a permanent state of exception from universal norms and protections.

If our moral compass has been severely tweaked in the new millennium, under Trump it may well be completely re-calibrated as the re-narration of what is necessary and permissible for governments to do in a democratic society again include torture, targeted killings, unlawful detention and worse.

The concept of human rights that has animated international law and activism for the past two centuries will be ill-suited to function in a thoroughly illiberal age, where entire religions, ethnicities and countries exist more or less in a permanent state of exception from universal norms and protections.

To borrow a concept from the eminent sociologist Manuel Castells, we are in the midst of a losing battle between two competing forms of identity, and the politics that go along with them, in the age of globalisation: an open, positive ""project identity"" that can foster liberal and even progressive values, and a closed, hostile ""resistance identity"" that encourages and even demands conflict to sustain itself.

Alexander Dugin, one of the loudest right-wing voices in Russia, put it succinctly after Trump's victory when he declared that ""the American people themselves have started the revolution against precisely the aspect of the US which we hated ... So let us [now] drain the European Swamp [of] Liberalism. We need a Nuremberg Trial for Liberalism, the last totalitarian political ideology.""

Not surprisingly, senior Trump adviser and Breitbart founder Steve Bannon has spoken approvingly of Dugin's ideas. If this is the level of rhetorical and moral judgment we can expect from the Trump brain trust, the next four years could well bring consequences even the most troubling predictions of the Trump era haven't imagined.

The camp is home to displaced civilians and to rebel groups that fight both President Bashar al-Assad and the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL, also known as ISIS) armed group, and was targeted by bombings last year.

Jordan's official Petra news agency, citing a military source, confirmed that an explosion went off inside the camp.

Syrian local media said the blast was caused by a car bomb and caused deaths and injuries.

There was no claim of responsibility for the bombing.

Home to more than 85,000 displaced people, the Rakban camp was also targeted by a bomb blast last month.

On Saturday, the Russian defence ministry said six Russian warplanes carried out air strikes on ISIL targets in the Deir Ezzor province, according to Russian media outlet RIA.

The ministry added that the planes flew from Russian territory and returned after the strikes, RIA said.

Peace talks

The attacks come as the Syrian government and rebel groups prepare for upcoming peace talks in Kazakhstan.

A ceasefire brokered by Russia and Turkey last month excluded the main hardline group in northwestern Syria, former al-Qaeda affiliate Jabhat Fateh al-Sham. Meanwhile a spate of air strikes targeting its leaders have increased mistrust among rebels.

All this plays further to Assad's advantage, as his Russian and Iranian allies want to lead diplomacy over Syria, with new US President Donald Trump indicating that he will cut backing for the moderate Syrian opposition.

The rebels going to Kazakhstan's Astana say the meeting must focus on shoring up the ceasefire and that they will resist political discussions. Assad has said he is open to such talks.

Syria's conflict started as a largely unarmed uprising against Assad's rule in March 2011, but it quickly morphed into a full-scale civil war.

The strike took place just a day before the end of President Barack Obama's presidency and a day after more than 80 fighters of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL, also known as ISIS) were killed in US air strikes in Libya, according to the Pentagon.

The official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said the air strike in Syria was primarily carried out by a B-52 bomber and dropped 14 munitions.

The official added that the strike against the camp took place in Idlib province, west of Aleppo, and there was a high level of confidence that there were no civilian casualties.

A US-led coalition has been carrying out air strikes and supporting local forces in Syria to oust ISIL.

Commanders killed

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported on Friday that an air strike killed more than 40 members of Jabhat Fateh al-Sham (formerly al-Qaeda's Syrian branch) in northwestern Syria.

It was not immediately clear if this strike was the same one to which the US defence official was referring.

A source in Fateh al-Sham confirmed to Al Jazeera that dozens had died in air strikes on a training camp in western Aleppo's countryside.

Jabhat Fateh al-Sham split from al-Qaeda in July, a move that analysts said was aimed at easing pressure from both Russia and the United States.

However, the group is not party to a Russian and Turkish-brokered ceasefire that went into effect on December 30.

OPINION: Tough choices ahead as al-Nusra splits from al-Qaeda

According to the Syrian Observatory, the group has sustained major losses in recent weeks with about 100 of its fighters killed since the start of 2017.

Al Jazeera's Stefanie Dekker, reporting from Gaziantep near the Turkey-Syria border, said the latest air strikes signalled a change in the campaign against the group.

""At least 10 senior commanders of the group have been killed among countless other fighters in Idlib province,"" she said.

""This raises the question of whether there is a change in policy, or if there's more intelligence coming in from the ground pinpointing where these leaders are.""

The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL, also known as ISIS) killed five Turkish soldiers and injured at least nine in a bombing in al-Bab, where Turkish-backed rebels have suffered casualties in a weeks-long bid to retake the town, according to the Dogan news agency.

Also on Friday, Turkish Deputy Prime Minister Mehmet Simsek said it was no longer ""realistic"" to insist on a solution to the Syria conflict without Assad.

Ankara acknowledged last year that Assad is an actor in Syria but it is the first time a senior Turkish official has openly said it would be unrealistic to insist on the embattled leader's departure for any solution.

""We have to be pragmatic, realistic. The facts on the ground have changed dramatically,"" Simsek told a panel on Syria at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.

""Turkey can no longer insist on a settlement without Assad. It is not realistic.""

Turkey, a vocal critic of Assad, has backed Syrian opposition rebels fighting to oust him since the complex conflict began with anti-government demonstrations in March 2011.

'Blame squarely on Assad'

""As far as our position on Assad is concerned, we think that the suffering of Syrian people and tragedies clearly ... the blame is squarely on Assad,"" Simsek said.

Turkey and Russia, which backs the Syrian government with military support, brokered a ceasefire deal between Assad's forces and rebel groups in late December, but violence has recently escalated across the country, particularly around the capital.

OPINION: How far is Russia willing to go in Syria?

Turkey, together with Russia and Iran, are convening talks next week in the Kazakh capital of Astana to shore up a ceasefire in Syria.

At Davos, Simsek said there had to be ""a beginning in Astana"" to make sure the conflict stops.

""For now at least the fighting has stopped, it is very, very critical because that is the beginning of anything else. The process is to make sure that we translate the current lull into a more lasting ceasefire initially, and then of course talk about more mundane stuff, settling the conflict.""

Five years of fighting has left hundreds of thousands of Syrians dead, while more than half of the country's prewar population has been displaced internally or fled the country.

Elsewhere on Friday, the United Nations condemned ISIL for the demolition of two monuments on sites in Syria's ancient city of Palmyra, calling the destruction a ""war crime"" and ""cultural cleansing"".

In a statement, Irina Bokova, director general of the Paris-based UN cultural agency UNESCO, described the wrecking as ""a new war crime and an immense loss for the Syrian people and for humanity.""

""This new blow against cultural heritage... shows that cultural cleansing led by violent extremists is seeking to destroy both human lives and historical monuments in order to deprive the Syrian people of its past and its future,"" Bokova said.

ISIL recaptured Palmyra, a UNESCO World Heritage site, from government forces on December 11 and the new devastation reportedly occurred earlier this month."

In a separate development, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL, also known as ISIS) demolished two monuments in the ancient city of Palmyra a month after recapturing it from government forces.

Maamoun Abdulkarim, Syria's antiquities chief, said on Friday that ISIL destroyed the tetrapylon - a 16-columned structure that marked one end of the ancient city's colonnade.

""Yesterday [Thursday] we received satellite photographs from our colleagues at Boston University showing damage to the facade of the Roman amphitheatre,"" he told AFP news agency.

Irina Bokova, director-general of UNESCO, condemned the attack calling it a ""new war crime"".

""This destruction is a new war crime and an immense loss for the Syrian people and for humanity.

""This new blow against cultural heritage - just a few hours after UNESCO received reports about mass executions in the theatre - shows that cultural cleansing led by violent extremists is seeking to destroy both human lives and historical monuments in order to deprive the Syrian people of its past and its future,"" Bokova said.

Before being forced out of Palmyra in a Russian-backed offensive in March last year, ISIL carried out a campaign of destruction at the city's UNESCO-listed world heritage site, razing treasured temples and towers tombs.

The Syrian conflict started as a largely unarmed uprising against Assad's rule in March 2011. It has since morphed into a full-scale war that has left hundreds of thousands dead and more than half of the country's prewar population displaced inside and outside of Syria."
65,https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2017/01/inevitable-trumputin-divorce-170119143312295.html,The inevitable Trumputin divorce,"After the inauguration of Donald Trump, media attention will be fixed on his first steps towards Russia. A lot has been said already about the difficult choice Trump faces after the hacking scandal: on the one hand, he promised voters he will improve relations with Moscow; on the other, any overture towards the Kremlin will be interpreted as a confirmation of the rumours about the alleged influence Russian President Vladimir Putin has over him. But little has been said about the dilemma that Putin himself faces, and that one is even more difficult.

On the one side, Trump's victory was an unexpected gift for the Kremlin, and it seems no one is trying to hide the fact. Russian state media are going out of their way to compliment the newly elected US president and smear his opponents.

For example, Russia's Channel One news reports portray Trump as a defender of the working class, who is harassed by deceitful media and attacked by paid demonstrators, and who will finally rescind an ""unpopular"" healthcare reform and defend the country against migrants. In other words, the Kremlin's propaganda defends the US president with such dedication, as if he were the Russian president.

One can understand why this is so. After all, many painful political issues are at stake. The main one is, of course, the repeal of the sanctions, which are harming not so much the Russian economy, as individuals in Putin's closest circle.

Another important issues is Ukraine. The Kremlin hopes to have Crimea recognised as Russian territory and not to have any weapon systems installed on Ukrainian territory. Of course, there are also expectations about the resolution of the Syrian question: Moscow hopes that Trump's administration won't demand that Assad steps down.

The Kremlin is happy about Trump's statements on NATO and it hopes that its expansion will stop and military deployment close to Russian borders will be curbed.

But there is another side to this coin: Trump's presidential victory could be a headache for Vladimir Putin as well.

The past 10 years, and especially since 2014, all internal Russian propaganda has been built on the concept of the external enemy - the West led by the US. The whole world believes that Russia is fighting in the Donbass region against Ukraine, but Russian media says Russia is fighting in Ukraine against the US. The whole world thinks that in Syria,Russia is defending Bashar al-Assad. But Russian media reports that in Syria Russia is resisting Washington's attempt to spread chaos through the armed groups it controls.

Looking for a new villain

The US is the answer to all painful questions. If the opposition in Russia organises marches, of course, it is the US which wants to destabilise Russia by paying activists to protests.

An economic crisis in the country? No, the problem is not corruption and ineffective governance, it is Western sanctions! And if a law banning ""homosexuality propaganda"" is being voted on, then that is justified with protecting society from the ""corrupting influence of the West"".

In fact, there is not one problem which the sharp-tongued Russian TV hosts cannot link to the US. For example, if you get detained without any reason, even beaten up in the police station, you wouldn't blame it on Washington. But it can always be pointed out that after all, in America the police would shoot you on the spot for even the slightest resistance.

OPINION: America was a 'stan' long before Trump

It may be possible to avoid this difficult situation by switching attention to other Western countries. To a certain extent, this has already happened: if 10 years ago, the attitude of Russians towards Europe was positive overall, today it is much more negative - even if Europe still fairs better than the US. State TV channels portray Europe as sinking in an economic crisis, suffering under the oppression of migrants, who invade the rights of citizens and promote debauchery - the Kremlin's media love to use the word ""Gayropa"" on these occasions.

In any case, Europe will not fit into the role of the new enemy. That is because this same propaganda regime was portraying Europe as a helpless and weak-willed marionette of the US. Then, of course, there needs to be another political figure embodying this enemy. Russians used to decorate their car bumpers with stickers insulting Obama. Who is going take his place? Angela Merkel? Theresa May? No, it won't work.

There is also another reason for Europe not fitting into the role of enemy No 1. The European Union is not really a state, but a group of counties which have different relations with the Kremlin. In the Czech Republic, Serbia, Hungary, Moldova and Bulgaria, Moscow has found some understanding. Relations with Italy are not that bad either. In Austria ""our"" candidate lost, but in France there will be two loyal candidates for the presidential elections - Marine Le Pen and Francois Fillon. And in Germany, there is space to challenge Merkel. In other words, the way Moscow sees it - not all is lost in Europe, and it is too early to demonise it.

'Nigeria with snow'

The US is Russia's perfect enemy because the Cold War ""feud"" made Russia in the eyes of its citizens as equally powerful as the US. After all, anti-American propaganda is not a Putin invention; it was a cornerstone of Soviet ideology. The rhetoric of anti-American slogans today is cut-and-pasted from Soviet propaganda. Having Russians remember an era when their country was a superpower competing with the US is very convenient for Putin as the Russian economy has shrunk to only 1.7 percent of the world's, and loyal allies willing to recognise Crimea as Russian territory are difficult to come by.

Without a conflict with the US, Russia would lose its power status and recede to the poor outskirts of Europe, a ""Nigeria with snow"", as Sergey Brin, the Moscow-born founder of Google, once described it.

In other words, while the Putin-Trump honeymoon may have been enjoyable, present circumstances are pressing for the break-up of this union. Just as Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie's perfect Brangelina union hit the rocks, so Trumputin is destined to end. But this will be to the benefit and relief of both sides. Sooner or later, Trump will start talking about corruption and dictatorship in Russia, while Putin's media will soon discover that Trump is a Wall Street ""insider"", a swindler and overall an illegitimate president who won fewer votes than Hillary Clinton.

It's possible this will not happen immediately. Trump will justify the revoking of the sanctions with the opportunity to get Russia to downsize its nuclear arsenal - a quite convenient for Russia, which can't afford to maintain a huge arsenal in times of economic crisis. Moscow, itself, hinted at this to Trump so lifting sanctions doesn't look like a one-sided concession.

It is clear that both sides will continue to make overtures for a while. After all this is reminiscent of George Bush, who looked into Putin's eyes and ""got a sense of his soul"", and Obama, who was trying to ""restart"" relations. In both cases love only lasted a short while.

Sooner or later, the lovers will be forced to realise that they are more Montague and Capulet than Romeo and Juliet .

Lieutenant-General Sergei Rudskoi, a senior defence ministry official, said on Wednesday that nine Russian and eight Turkish fighter jets had together struck targets in the town, located northeast of Aleppo.

""Today the Russian and Turkish air forces are conducting their first joint air operation to strike [ISIL] in the suburbs of Al Bab,"" Rudskoi said.

""The assessment of the initial results ... showed the strikes were highly effective.""

The joint operation, the closest cooperation between the two countries in Syria to date, marks a dramatic warming of ties between Turkey and Russia, once strained by the shooting down of a Russian jet by a Turkish warplane in 2015.

""Turkey and Russia signed a memorandum of de-confliction in Moscow at the end of last week,"" Al Jazeera's Stefanie Dekker, reporting from Gaziantep on the Turkish side of the Syria-Turkey border, said.

""They agreed to communicate when it comes to the aviation airspace, because the airspace above Syria is very busy with many different countries flying.""

The two countries have backed opposing sides in the nearly six-year Syrian conflict, but are now the main organisers of a new round of peace talks due to take place in Kazakhstan on January 23.

They have set aside their differences over the political fate of President Bashar al-Assad to try to forge a wider Syria deal.

US involvement

Separately, US-led coalition jets also struck ISIL positions in Al Bab on Tuesday and Wednesday, according to coalition spokesman Colonel John Dorrian.

""These strikes were the result of continued cooperation with Turkey, and we saw a window of opportunity where it was in our mutual interests to get those targets destroyed,"" Dorrian said.

Turkey has previously criticised the United States for not helping it in its attempts to capture the area from ISIL, which stands for Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant.

Earlier this month, Mevlut Cavusoglu, Turkey's foreign minister, had hinted about cutting off US access to the Incirlik air base, in southeastern Turkey, if it did not support its fight against ISIL, also known as ISIS.

Turkey launched an anti-ISIL push in northern Syria in August after the group carried out multiple attacks targeting civilians security forces across the country.

Dubbed Operation Euphrates Shield, the offensive is composed of Turkish-trained Free Syrian Army (FSA) units backed by Turkish special forces, armoured divisions and fighter jets.

Despite early success in capturing territory from ISIL, such as in the towns of Jarablus and Azaz, the offensive has met stiff resistance in the town of al-Bab.

Turkey lost 16 soldiers in a suicide bombing in the town in December and has lost 49 troops since the launch of the operation.

Battling ISIL

A number of forces, often rivals themselves, are fighting ISIL in Syria and neighbouring Iraq.

In Iraq, Kurdish and Iraqi forces - backed by the US-led coalition - have succeeded in pushing the fighters out of most of the major cities it once held, but are facing determined resistance in Mosul, the group's last urban stronghold in the country.

In Syria, the group managed to wrest the historic city of Palmyra from Syrian government control in December and this week made gains in the eastern city of Deir Az Zor.

ISIL captured most of the territory it now holds in Syria and Iraq after a series of rapid offensives starting in early 2014."

Water supplies from the rebel-held Wadi Barada valley near Damascus have been severed since December 22 with the government and rebels trading blame.

Jan Egeland, head of a UN-backed humanitarian task force for Syria, said on Thursday that the shutdown already had ""dramatic"" consequences.

Water supply from Wadi Barada to 5,5 million in Damascus has been cut since Dec 22 with dramatic consequences. UN need access to do repairs. — Jan Egeland (@NRC_Egeland) January 5, 2017

He said water supplies to 5.5 million people had been hit ""because of fighting, or because of sabotage or because of both"".

""To sabotage and deny water is of course a war crime, because it is civilians who drink it and civilians who will be affected by waterborne diseases"" if supplies are not restored, he told reporters in Geneva.

The UN Office for the Coordination Humanitarian Affairs has said that water supplies were cut off because ""infrastructure was deliberately targeted and damaged"" - without saying who was responsible.

The government has accused rebels of polluting the springs with diesel, while the opposition says government bombing destroyed the village's water plant.

The Syrian army and its allies pressed ahead on Friday with a two-week-long offensive to seize the strategic valley, in spite a ceasefire in place since last week.

Aerial bombing and shelling from the army as well as Hezbollah fighters stationed in the mountains that overlook the valley on the northwestern edge of the capital have intensified in the past 48 hours.

The Reuters news agency cited residents and rebels saying scores of fighter jets pounded the area around the Ain al-Fija springs and the villages of Baseimah, Kafr Zayt, and al-Husseineh, which form part of a cluster of 10 villages controlled by rebels in the Wadi Barada region.

OPINION: The Assad conundrum

Fighters there rejected a government offer to leave the area for the rebel-held province of Idlib in northern Syria. Similar deals have led rebels to yield swaths of territory, including in the city of Aleppo

The military offensive has strained a ceasefire agreement brokered by Russia and Turkey aimed at bringing about Syrian peace talks in Kazakhstan later this month.

The opposition has warned that unless the Syrian army halts its attacks it would consider any truce ""null and void"". They have also suspended any discussion on participating in the forthcoming peace talks unless Russia puts pressure on the government and its Tehran-backed allies to abort the offensive.

The government says forces in Wadi Barada include Jabhat Fateh al-Sham, previously known as the al-Qaeda-linked al-Nusra Front, which Moscow and Damascus say is excluded from the ceasefire.

Rebels deny the group is in the area.

READ MORE: Damascus accuses rebels of polluting water supplies

The rupture of water supplies from the springs has caused severe shortages after the pumping station of Ain al-Fija - that supplied about 70 percent of the capital's water needs - was damaged.

Prices of bottled water and trucked water supplied by private traders to residential homes has tripled, residents of the capital say, with a black market now thriving.

The government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has also brought in supplies from other provinces by tanker to cover some of the shortfall in the capital and pumped extra water from underground wells.

The civilian population in the valley is estimated by the United Nations to number about 45,000, but civic groups say the total is double that, with their plight worsening daily under heavy shelling and shortages of food and medicine.

Dozens of homes have been hit by the bombing campaign.

Only 1,200 families have so far left to a government-run shelter in the nearby town of Rawda, the UN said.

""We hope in a few days water will return back to the capital after the army takes back Ain al-Fija. The army is advancing and ... we expect good news,"" Alaa Munir Ibrahim, a governor in the Damascus suburbs, told state media."

Thursday's attack in Latakia province is the first such explosion since a new ceasefire, brokered by Russia and Turkey, took effect last week.

""A terrorist car bomb attack took place near the Municipal Stadium in Jableh,"" state news agency SANA said.

Jableh is close to a Russian airbase and lies in the heartland of Syria's Alawites, a Shia offshoot to which President Bashar al-Assad's family belongs.

Latakia province police chief Yasser al-Shariti told state TV that the explosion hit during rush hour in one of the city's main streets.

State TV showed footage of mangled cars and the shutters of shops damaged and blown apart as rescue workers cleared the debris amid a heavy security presence in the bustling commercial area near a popular vegetable market and a garage depot.

As most of Syria’s government-held coastal cities and towns, Jableh has enjoyed relative stability during the almost six-year conflict.

In May, however, a string of blasts hit first a crowded bus station in the city, then outside a hospital that was receiving the wounded. About 120 people died in that attack, which was claimed by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) group.

No group immediately claimed responsibility for Thursday's bombing. ISIL and several other groups are not part of the broad truce that the government and the opposition agreed on recently."

The Russian-Turkish brokered ceasefire last week has brought calm to large parts of Syria, but has been threatened by ongoing fighting in the Wadi Barada region near the capital, Damascus.

Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu on Wednesday urged the Syrian government and its backers to end their ""violations"" of the truce, warning that they were jeopardising the planned talks to be held in Astana this month.

""If we do not stop the increasing violations, the Astana process could fail. After the ceasefire, we see violations,"" Cavusoglu told the state-run Anadolu news agency.

Syrian government forces, backed by Lebanon's armed Hezbollah group, are fighting to recapture Wadi Barada, the main source of water to Damascus.

READ MORE: Syria army presses fight near Damascus despite truce

Cavusoglu urged Russia and Iran, which both back Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and are also helping to prepare the Astana talks, to pressure Damascus and Hezbollah to stop the fighting.

Despite the call, fighting continued on the ground in Wadi Barada on Wednesday, the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a monitoring group, said.



It reported ongoing clashes as well as government air strikes and artillery fire in the area, but had no immediate details on casualties.

Syria's main rebel groups said on Tuesday they have already frozen their participation in the preliminary peace talks due to what they called several ""violations"" by the regime of the truce that came into effect last week.

""The regime and its allies have not stopped shooting and have launched major and frequent violations, notably in the regions of Wadi Barada and Eastern Ghouta,"" the groups said in a joint statement.

Water supply damaged

Wadi Barada has been under government siege since 2015, but government forces upped the pressure on the region several weeks ago as they tried to secure a ""reconciliation deal"" with rebels there.



The regime has reached a series of such deals with opposition forces around Damascus in recent months, offering rebels safe passage to other parts of the country in return for their surrender.

The government accuses rebels in the area of deliberately targeting water infrastructure, causing leaking fuel to poison the supply to the capital, and then cutting the flow altogether.

Rebels say the infrastructure was damaged in government strikes, and deny responsibility for the damage that has left four million people without water since December 22.

The UK-based Observatory said about 1,000 civilians - all of them women and children - fled the fighting in Wadi Barada over the weekend, moving to other parts of the province.

Syria's conflict started as a largely unarmed uprising against Assad's rule but quickly turned into a full-scale civil war that has killed at least 400,000 civilians, according to United Nations estimates."

Turkey's state-run news agency, Anadolu said that an ongoing series of tips or sightings from citizens led to half a dozen more detentions on Tuesday, as the main suspect, who allegedly carried out the attack, remains at large.

The suspects continue to be questioned at Istanbul's main police headquarters, media said, adding that security experts say the killer was an experienced assassin. Turkish police have released a photo of him.

The release of the image on Monday came as Deputy Prime Minister Numan Kurtulmus said that the country's state of emergency, which was already in place at the time of the attack, would be extended for as long as needed.

The parliament voted on the issue on Tuesday to extend it for another three months, following a six-month mandate.

Turks mourn the dead (2:22)

Kurtulmus also said authorities were close to identifying the gunman after obtaining his fingerprints and a description of his appearance.

The attack was claimed by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL, also known as ISIS).

TIMELINE: Attacks in Turkey

""Information about the fingerprints and basic appearance of the terrorist have been found. In the process after this, work to identify him swiftly will be carried out,"" Kurtulmus told a news conference.

He said it was clear that Turkey's military incursion into Syria, launched in August, had annoyed armed groups and those behind them, but said the offensive would continue until all threats to Turkey were removed.

Turkey sent tanks and special forces into Syria just over four months ago to push back ISIL fighters from its border and prevent Kurdish fighters from taking ground in their wake.

Kurtulmus also said Sunday's attack bore significant differences to previous attacks in Turkey and that it had been carried out to create divisions within Turkish society.

Al Jazeera's Mohammed Jamjoom, reporting from Istanbul, said that citizens he spoke to in various parts of Istanbul were concerned that those types of attacks might become more common in the future.

He said: ""They are still shocked. It is astounding for them that an attack of this magnitude could happen at such a high-profile club, at a time this country is under a state of emergency, and tens of thousands of security officers spread out throughout the city were trying to prevent such an attack from happening on New Year's Eve.""

Foreigners killed

The assailant, who is believed to be of Central Asian decent, slipped from the scene of the attack at the Reina club early on Sunday, taking advantage of the chaos that ensued after he opened fire.

Turkish media ran on Tuesday a selfie-style video of a man they say is the gunman. Broadcast on Turkish television, the footage shows the alleged attacker filming himself at the central Taksim Square. It was not immediately clear if it was filmed before the attack.

As the operation to close in on the suspect continued, Turkish victims were laid to rest as families of those from other countries arrived in the country to take their loved ones' remains back home.

The majority of those killed were foreigners, including many Arab nationals.

The victims included citizens of Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Lebanon, Iraq, France, Tunisia, India, Morocco, Jordan, Kuwait, Canada, Israel, Syria, Belgium, Germany and Russia."

The groups suspending their participation included the Free Syrian Army, one of the biggest coalitions fighting against President Bashar al-Assad, and the Army of Conquest, another coalition of anti-government groups.

""The regime and its allies have not stopped shooting and have launched major and frequent violations, notably in the regions of Wadi Barada and Eastern Ghouta.

""Any [advance] on the ground goes against the [ceasefire] agreement and if things don't return to how they were before, the accord will be considered null and void,"" the statement added.

OPINION: The Assad conundrum

Al Jazeera's Hashem Ahelbarra, reporting from the Turkish city of Gaziantep near the Syria border, called the FSA's announcement a ""significant setback"".

""The rebels say they signed the ceasefire in good faith but that the Syrian regime and its ally Russia have failed to live up to their end of the deal,"" he said.

""They say fighter jets have continued to pound rebel-held areas across the country with barrel bombs, particularly Wadi Barada.""

For the last two weeks, Syria's air force, backed by Hezbollah and Shia militias, have launched almost daily bombing raids on Wadi Barada, some 15km from Damascus.

The Assad government is trying to seize control of the region, which supplies the main drinking water for roughly four million inhabitants of the capital and surrounding areas.

The UN's Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said supplies had been cut since December 22 because ""infrastructure was deliberately targeted and damaged"", without saying who was responsible.

Water is now being rationed in Damascus as the government is relying on reserves.

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said about 1,000 civilians - all of them women and children - fled the fighting in Wadi Barada over the weekend, moving to other parts of the province.

Wadi Barada has been surrounded by government forces since mid-2015, but the siege was tightened in late December as the army piled on pressure seeking to secure a ""reconciliation"" deal.

It has won several of these deals in opposition areas around the capital, offering safe passage to surrendering rebels in return for retaking territory.

The opposition criticises them as a ""starve or surrender"" tactic.

OPINION: Whitewashing Assad and his allies must be challenged

The violence threatens the delicate ceasefire, which has been in force since midnight Thursday, and is intended to pave the way for new peace talks in Astana later this month.

Turkey and Russia are organising the talks in Astana along with ally Iran, and say they are intended to supplement, not replace, UN-backed negotiations scheduled to resume in February.

Despite backing opposite sides in Syria's conflict, Ankara and Moscow have worked closely in recent months on the war, brokering a deal to evacuate civilians and surrendering rebels from Aleppo last month, before government forces recaptured the northern city in full.

The truce excludes the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL, also known as ISIS) group and Jabhat Fateh al-Sham, the group former known as the al-Nusra Front."

The violence threatens the delicate truce that came into force last week and is intended to pave the way for new peace talks in Kazakhstan later this month.

Four civilians and nine rebels have been killed since the truce began, but officially it is still holding.

OPINION: The Assad conundrum

In a statement, rebels fighting under the Free Syrian Army banner in the Wadi Barada warned the truce was in danger of collapse.

""We call on the sponsors of the ceasefire agreement to assume their responsibility and pressure the regime and its allied militias to stop their clear violation of the agreement,"" the statement said.

Otherwise, they warned, ""we will call on all the free military factions operating inside Syria to overturn the agreement and ignite the fronts in defence of the people of Wadi Barada"".

The statement said Wadi Barada was included in the deal brokered by Moscow and Ankara and accused the regime of violating the agreement.

The ceasefire deal, and the plan for new talks, received the unanimous backing of the UN Security Council on Saturday, despite offering a competing track to UN-sponsored negotiations.

The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL, also known as ISIS) group released on Monday a statement claiming responsibility for the raid.

""In continuation of the blessed operations that Islamic State is conducting against the protector of the cross, Turkey, a heroic soldier of the caliphate struck one of the most famous nightclubs where the Christians celebrate their apostate holiday,"" the statement said.

The announcement came as a manhunt was under way in Turkey for at least one assailant who attacked those celebrating New Year at the Reina nightclub.

Shortly after the ISIL claim, AFP news agency citing local media said that police have detained eight suspects over the attack.

The Dogan news agency said police were pressing on with operations after making the first arrests over the attack.

The Reina lies on the shore of the Bosphorus Strait and is one of Istanbul's best-known nightclubs, popular with locals and tourists alike. During the attack, some partygoers who managed to flee jumped into the freezing cold Bosphorus strait to escape harm.

Al Jazeera's Mohammed Jamjoom, reporting from Istanbul, said: ""The ISIL statement doesn't say whether the attacker was trained by ISIL or simply pledged allegiance to the group and carried out the attack alone.

""There had been consensus emerging behind the scenes, and reports in Turkish media, indicating officials believed ISIL was behind the attack.""

He added that the mood in the busy Turkish city was ""sombre and sad"".

Turkey is currently in a state of emergency.

""People are very scared. This is the fourth attack to hit Turkey in less than a month ... There is a sense here in Istanbul of astonishment as to how this could have happened at a time when there were tens of thousands of officers on the streets to prevent an attack on New Year's Eve.""

As well as the 39 dead, about 70 others were wounded and three of those people remain in critical condition, Binali Yildirim, Turkey's prime minister, said on Sunday.

Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu described the attack as a ""massacre, a truly inhumane savagery"".

Foreigners, including many nationals of Arab countries, were among the dead, officials said.

Eleven of the dead were Turkish nationals and one was a Turkish-Belgium dual-national. Seven victims were from Saudi Arabia and had travelled to Istanbul for New Year's Eve celebrations. Three of the dead were from Lebanon and Iraq each. Two nationals from Tunisia, India, Morocco and Jordan were killed, and Kuwait, Canada, Israel, Syria and Russia lost one citizen in the attack.

One victim remains unidentified.

TIMELINE: Attacks in Turkey

Security measures had been heightened in major Turkish cities, with police barring traffic leading up to key squares in Istanbul and Ankara.

In Istanbul, 17,000 police officers were put on duty, some disguised as Santa Claus and others as street vendors, Turkey's Anadolu news agency reported.

Turkey, part of the US-led coalition against ISIL, faces multiple security threats, including fallout from the war in neighbouring Syria.

It has seen repeated attacks and bombings blamed on ISIL, as well as fighters from the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) in recent months."
93,https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2017/01/syria-future-bashar-al-assad-170102073404800.html,Can we have an integral Syria without Bashar Al-Assad?,"It is safe to say that, until recently, the debate over Syria's political future came down to one thing: the fate of President Bashar al-Assad. With his victory in Aleppo, and the firm support of Iran and Russia, it is also fairly safe to say that the Syrian president's future is secure, for the time being.

What is it about Assad that has made him such a key issue? Some argued that without his rule, radical Islamists (ISIL, Jabhat Fateh al-Sham etc) would take over Syria.

This has not only presented a threat to Syria and its minorities, but it was a problem for Europe, Russia and beyond. As Russia, Iran and Assad have repeated: only Assad and his system can effectively keep them at bay.

The counterargument has been that it is Assad who is the very source of this terror. His rule had restricted political space and created enough anger that young men were driven to extremes.

It was also Assad that had sent radical Islamists to fight in Iraq against the American occupation, and more recently released them from his prisons, so they could feed the ranks of the extremists; that is to say, he is both arsonist and firefighter.

Is he really indispensable?

For some, Assad is also favoured because he is the only option that can maintain the territorial sovereignty and integrity of Syria.

His toughness and strong centralised state are sine qua non to avoid centrifugal forces. From this view, the opposition is not only radicalised, but its moderate elements are fragmented and unrepresentative - most have no local constituency. If integrity is the goal, then Assad is the key.

The counterargument is that Assad has already destroyed the country while trying to keep it whole. Armies of extremists could not have done the damage that Assad and his allies have done.

Millions are displaced, wounded or dead, thousands of others languish in prison. If he had saved Syria from the worse fate of a caliphate, his actions have still created a mentality of violence.

This is the Assad conundrum: Can you have an integral Syria without him? Can you have a healthy Syria with him?

It's difficult to believe that the future of a country would so turn on the fate of one man. There are recent reports that Russia, Turkey and Iran are looking at a formula whereby Assad will leave after the end of his current term, possibly replaced by a less problematic Alawite.

However, that deal is not yet done, and the contradictions between those three powers, and Assad's very role, suggest great challenges.

The rarest of 21st-century commodities

We may be looking in the wrong place. There may be a more subtle question that steers the gaze away from the man: How can Syria evolve over time in a direction that is healthy and enriching for its people?

Given the need for stability and a less radical positive evolution, one can imagine the possibility of a ""benevolent dictator"", someone who holds the fort, while permitting enough space for a better system to come about.

They address both sides of the conundrum; a modern Haroun Al Rashid or China's Deng Xiaoping come to mind, as exemplars.

However, there is little evidence that Assad or other tyrants are such figures - it would seem they are in power for their own benefit, period. Indeed, such figures, effectively ""philosopher-kings"" are rare and societies risk much betting on their arrival.

It's the deeper societal and cultural work, not the Assad conundrum, that's required to move Syria slowly, but surely, towards health.

Both sides of the conundrum may point to something else at the societal level itself. ISIL and Assad may be linked, not in the conspiratorial sense, but in that they are both the tragic representatives of a culture of violence and authoritarianism. The evolution away from that involves a change in societal habits more than just in politics.

Syrians who suffer from both these twin plagues may shudder; that they are damned to a choice between tyranny and extremism. Many may feel ready today for a less brutal society.

However, it may well be that their politics reflect their society more than the other way around. Despite certain beliefs, their challenge may not only be from aggravating outsiders.

If that is the case, the best way forward would be to create a culture in Syria that is less primed for tyranny, whether of the ideological variety, such as ISIL, or the state-driven form, like Assad. In the longer run, such a culture and society will more firmly reject both.

OPINION: Whitewashing Assad and his allies must be challenged

This work will be quickened if countries concerned with maintaining the status quo for their own benefit lessen their meddling. Others pining for instant democracy may also need to sober up a bit.

It's the deeper societal and cultural work, not the Assad conundrum, that's required to move Syria slowly, but surely, towards health. And doing that requires the rarest of commodities in the rapid-fire politics of the 21st century: time. Who has the patience and outlook for such work today?

Some perspective, and a little inspiration, may be gained by knowing that the Syrian culture that produced the Umayyad Mosque of Damascus, or the cultural plenitude of Aleppo, has little, if anything, to do with the mind that produces ISIL - or Assad for that matter.

The Syrian military said some 1,300 people fled the Barada Valley region since Saturday. The region has been the target of days of air strikes and shelling despite the truce, which was brokered by Russia and Turkey and appears to be holding in other parts of the country, despite some reports of fighting.

The truce went into effect early Friday, and the government and the opposition are expected to meet for talks in Kazakhstan later this month.

OPINION: How blood feud is growing among the Syrian youth

Russia, a key military ally of Syrian president Bashar al-Assad, and Turkey, a leading sponsor of the rebels, are acting as guarantors of the agreement, which excludes Jabhat Fateh al-Sham - formerly known as al-Nusra Front - and the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant group.

On Saturday, the UN Security Council unanimously adopted a resolution supporting efforts by Russia and Turkey to end the nearly six-year conflict in Syria and jump start peace negotiations.

The military said those fleeing Barada Valley were relocated to safer areas and their names were registered by the Syrian Arab Red Crescent.

Rami Abdurrahman, who heads the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, said there were buses in the region ready to evacuate civilians, but could not confirm how many people had left.

He said the Barada Valley region is not part of the ceasefire because of the presence of Jabhat Fateh al-Sham.

The Barada Valley Media Center said Lebanese Hezbollah fighters were firing on villages and towns in the water-rich region as Russian and government aircraft carried out raids for the 10th consecutive day on Saturday. The Lebanese group has sent thousands of fighters to Syria to bolster Assad's forces.

The Barada Valley is the primary source of water for the capital Damascus and its surrounding region.

The government assault has coincided with a severe water shortage in Damascus since December 22. Images from the valley's Media Center indicate its Ain al-Fijeh spring and water processing facility have been destroyed in air strikes. The government says rebels spoiled the water source with diesel fuel, forcing it to cut supplies to the capital.

The Syrian Observatory and the Aleppo Media Center, an activist collective, reported government air strikes on rebel-held villages near the northern city of Aleppo, which was recently returned to full government control.

State news agency, SANA, said two suicide attackers blew themselves up in the coastal city of Tartus, killing two security officers who had stopped them shortly after midnight, as residents were celebrating New Year's Day.

A news website close to Iran's Revolutionary Guard, meanwhile, said General Gholam Ali Gholizadeh, a veteran of the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s, was killed fighting in Syria. It did not provide further details. Iran is also closely allied with Assad."

The resolution, approved late on Saturday, called for the ""rapid, safe and unhindered"" delivery of humanitarian aid throughout the country.

Russia, which supports Syria's President Bashar al-Assad, brokered the ceasefire with Turkey earlier this week in the hope of paving the way for peace talks in Kazakhstan in the new year.

The truce calls for negotiations over a political solution to end the conflict that has killed more than 400,000 people and forced millions to flee.

READ MORE: Syrian activists languish in government jails

Vitaly Churkin, Russia's ambassador to the UN, praised efforts to end the year with an international agreement for Syria and thanked Turkey for its ""substantive contribution"".

""It is very important that the Security Council backed these efforts by Russia and Turkey,"" he said.

Endorsing the resolution ""means that if all of us look together to certain objectives rather than to attempt to gain benefit, then we are able to make important decisions"".

However, in remarks after the vote, several delegates voiced their concern, saying the agreement contained grey areas and that its implementation was fragile.

Amendments accepted

Al Jazeera's Mike Hanna, reporting from the UN headquarters in New York City, said Russia was forced to accept a number of amendments to see the resolution pass.

""Key among them was that the Russia-Turkey brokered ceasefire was part of a wider UN initiative aimed at restoring political dialogue,"" he said.

""Russia has made it clear that this resolution is in no way meant to supplant a UN push to start talks in Geneva.""

Staffan de Mistura, the UN special envoy for Syria, has said he intends to bring together representatives of the rival parties for talks in Geneva after February 8.

The truce remained largely intact on Saturday, despite opposition forces accusing Assad loyalists of attacking 33 locations.

Rebel groups threatened to abandon the ceasefire if the government continued its assault on areas under their control.

Rebel leaders told Al Jazeera that Assad's government were trying to take advantage of the situation to further expand its territory.

At least 10 air strikes hit rebel-held villages and towns in the strategically important Wadi Barada valley near Damascus, activists said.

Delicate moment for truce

Al Jazeera's Hashem Ahelbarra, reporting from Turkey's Gaziantep near the Syria border, said it was a delicate moment for the ceasefire.

""They [Syrian rebel groups] have sent an urgent appeal to the UN and to Turkey, which is the key player in the ceasefire, to negotiate with the Russians and try to stop the Syria government, warning that if this continues, there will be no option but to resume the fighting,"" he said.

OPINION: Who are we to say the Syrian revolution is dead?

""The terms of the ceasefire insist that the moment it comes into effect, there should be no military operation, no party should take advantage of it. But the Syrian opposition would need that guarantee, that the guns must fall silent across Syria.""

The Syrian civil war started as a largely unarmed uprising against Assad in March 2011, but quickly developed into a full-on armed conflict.

Calculating a precise death toll is difficult, partially owing to the forced disappearances of tens of thousands of Syrians whose fates remain unknown.

Almost 11 million Syrians - half the country's prewar population - have been displaced from their homes."

Thronged by UN staff as he made his way out of UN headquarters on Friday, the South Korean diplomat thanked his colleagues, saying it was an honour to have worked with them.

""You should be very proud, just as I am so very proud to call you my colleagues,"" he said.

The 72-year-old transfers stewardship of the world body to Antonio Guterres, a former Portuguese prime minister, amid continuing conflicts in Syria, Yemen, Mali, the Central African Republic and Libya, to name but a few.

Ban said he lamented the ""fires still burning"", and in a rare show of criticism of world leaders, criticised unnamed presidents, prime ministers and monarchs for the turmoil.

Singling out Syria, he said he could not understand why it was being held hostage to ""the destiny"" of Bashar al-Assad.

The Syrian conflict has killed an estimated 400,000 people, contributed to Europe's worst refugee crisis since World War II and allowed the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) group to emerge as a global threat.

Turning elsewhere, Ban said in his decade at the UN he had endeavoured ""to never give up. To keep dreaming, to keep believing, and to keep working hard until we achieve progress"".

He urged UN staff to remain focused on advancing UN development goals and work towards addressing issues ranging from climate change to gender empowerment.

Mixed legacy

Despite serving two terms and being unanimously re-elected in 2011, Ban leaves behind a mixed legacy.

In his first term, he was criticised for not speaking out against human rights abuses in China and Russia.

And, in his second term, for the UN's handling of the cholera epidemic in Haiti and its failure to deal effectively with sexual abuses by UN peacekeepers in the Central African Republic and elsewhere.

His decision to remove an Arab coalition bombing Yemen from a UN blacklist after Saudi Arabia threatened to stop funding UN programmes was sharply rebuked.

On the other hand, he has won plaudits for helping move climate change to the top of the global agenda and strongly backing gay rights despite opposition from many countries.

From Sunday, Guterres, 67, takes over from Ban. He is the first former head of government to lead the UN and will preside over a five-year term."
99,https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2016/12/media-2017-161230144352351.html,The media we need in 2017,"On December 20, in a piece both depressingly necessary and emblematic of the year, Britain's Channel 4 news released a fact-check. It assessed claims by a writer for the Russian state media channel Russia Today.

As terrible reports of injured and dead civilians, many of them children, poured out of besieged and bombarded Aleppo, this writer suggested in a speech to the United Nations that western journalists were ""compromised"" and that the same bleeding children were being recycled in different reports.

Channel 4 ran through factors explaining why it was ""beyond reasonable doubt"" that the pictures in dispute were in fact credible, adding: ""… the simpler explanation is the more likely one: children really are being orphaned in Syria, or left wounded and distressed …""

This is the bit that highlights the trouble we're in: that the truth of journalists not being able to verify all information coming out of Syria leads some to believe that everything reported by otherwise credible news outlets must therefore be fake - including attacks on children.

Politics as entertainment

To a degree, this is nothing new: propaganda is a part of war - we've seen battles over information in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and in particular during the Gaza war of 2008, when Israel did not grant Western media access to the strip.

But, in the year of Brexit and Donald Trump, neither of which the media saw coming, the talk has been of a broken media, unable to usefully analyse, report or inform while at the same time being flooded with fake news.

There are various ways to read the UK vote to leave the European Union, or the United States election outcome - but concern that the media is no longer trusted and is failing to inform keeps coming up in the mix.

From the fake news farms in Macedonia, to the role of Facebook - now a prime news source - in spreading it, to the far-right gaming Google's algorithms so that Hitler is good and Jews are evil, it seems we're flooded with false information.

And if that were not bad enough, we also have a media obsessed with entertainment value to the extent that the resurgence of the far-right is portrayed as a hipster sensation.

The digital age has perhaps created a privileging of opinions over slow, expensive reporting - so then it can't be a surprise when facts are no longer sacred and everyone's view, however malicious, deceitful or bigoted, is seen as deserving of airtime.

And there's trouble in the unthinking pursuit of balance, which has created false equivalence. This showed up in the US election campaign, when Trump and Hillary Clinton were treated as equally flawed.

If politics is presented as entertainment, it can be no surprise that the populist right will play to that: Trump mastered it, but so did the anti-Islam leader of the Dutch Party for Freedom, Geert Wilders. As did Nigel Farage, former leader of the Brexit-pushing UK Independence Party - the party has one seat in parliament but Farage is a ubiquitous media presence because, well, it's amusing, isn't it?

But it's no secret that airtime can elevate the popularity of a political party: in giving access and a platform, media signals to its audience that the politician in question is acceptable and viable. You might legitimately ask why, in this context, Farage gets more attention in the UK than, say the Green Party (one sitting MP) or the Liberal Democrats (eight MPs).

Giving platform to the extreme

You might also question the value of giving platform to extreme, hateful voices - the idea may be to challenge and debunk such views, but the outcome can be a widening of exposure and legitimacy.

This was the debate swirling about the Daily Show's interview between host Trevor Noah and Tomi Lahren, a YouTube hit with a line in angry, race-baiting rants.

Perhaps there is something to learn from the way German media reports on the far-right - having played a role in Germany's de-Nazification effort, it has historically been more wary of giving hateful or anti-immigration views a platform and is now calibrating such decisions in the face of the country's far-right party, the AfD.

OPINION: 2016 and the truth behind fake news

Several German journalists I spoke with noted that, following the horrific lorry attack in Berlin last week, media coverage was mostly restrained over bringing in voices that blamed refugees for the attack.

The digital age has perhaps created a privileging of opinions over slow, expensive reporting - so then it can't be a surprise when facts are no longer sacred and everyone's view, however malicious, deceitful or bigoted, is seen as deserving of airtime.

Post-Trump and Brexit, media outlets stand accused of not listening to or reporting the public mood. But, as journalist and campaigner Paris Lees, who comes from a British area that voted to leave the EU, told the BBC's Newsnight programme last week: ""Nobody wants to listen to us when we want to talk about housing or schools or jobs … but suddenly, when people have got racist concerns, everybody wants to listen.""

Part of giving power to the far-right is to do with prioritising their preferred issues. What would happen if there were just as much coverage of housing, jobs or corporate tax avoidance as there has been on immigration?

The one thing we need

You could also make the case that counter-narratives to the far-right are insufficiently reported. Redressing this might mean giving space to lives, work and campaigns that challenge the arguments and appeal of the populist right - or it might be about amplifying positive political activities.

For instance, when UK Labour MP Jo Cox was murdered by a far-right terrorist earlier this year, Guardian readers asked why they had not previously heard of this MP's tireless campaigning for her constituency, for Syria and for refugees.

This resulted in a piece about the ""unsung MPs quietly making Britain better"". Of course politicians and governments should be held to account by the media, but if good work isn't reported, it cements the idea that parliamentarians are ubiquitously self-serving and corrupt - something that the far-right has pounced upon and used as a part of its social diagnosis.

At the end of a year of ruptured politics in the West, there's a tendency to look for something to blame: Elites, the working class, Facebook, the Russians.

OPINION: Another incurable, ugly disease - Far-right populism

None of this finger-pointing will solve complex structural, political and economic problems that have been brewing for some time and have multiple causes.

But while we take a hard look at how we got here and scrutinise what's ahead, the one thing we do need is a robust media, one that can handle it - one that can question and challenge the state we're in, rather than collective collapsing into despair or acquiescence.

It said government forces and their allies had been trying to press advances, particularly in an area northwest of Damascus.

Al Jazeera's Hashem Ahelbarra, reporting from Turkey's Gaziantep near the Syria border, said it was a delicate moment for the ceasefire.

""They [Syrian rebel groups] have sent an urgent appeal to the UN and to Turkey, who is the key player in the ceasefire, to negotiate with the Russians and try to stop the Syria government from fighting, warning that if the fighting continues there will be no option but to resume the fighting,"" he said.

""The terms of the ceasefire insist that the moment it comes in to effect there should be no military operation, no party should take advantage of it. But the Syria opposition would need that guarantee that the guns must fall silent across Syria.""

Russia, which supports Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, has urged the UN to give its blessing to the fragile ceasefire, the third truce this year seeking to end nearly six years of war in Syria.

Russia and Turkey, which backs the armed opposition to Assad, brokered the ceasefire agreement in the hope of preparing the way for peace talks in Kazakhstan in the new year.

In their statement, the rebels said it appeared the government and the opposition had signed two different versions of the ceasefire deal, one of which was missing ""a number of key and essential points that are non-negotiable"", but did not say what those were.

""There is a different interpretation on this ceasefire between Syrian opposition groups on the one hand and the Russians and other parties on the other,"" Marwan Kabalan, an analyst at Doha Institute, told Al Jazeera.

There was confusion over which groups in the opposition are included in the ceasefire. The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL, also known as ISIS) group, which has made enemies of all sides in the conflict, is not included.

""The opposition said the ceasefire includes all Syrian factions excluding ISIL, whereas the Russians said it would exclude all UN-designated terrorist organisations including al-Nusra Front,"" said Kabalan. ""This [difference] is a ticking bomb that will jeopardise the whole process as the Syrian forces will go after al-Nusra and that will put the Syrian opposition factions in a very difficult position.""

The ceasefire deal calls for negotiations over a political solution to end the conflict that has killed more than 310,000 people and forced millions to flee.

Talks in Astana

Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Friday that he would now reduce Moscow's military contingent in Syria, which has been fighting to bolster the government since last year.

But he added that Russia would continue to fight ""terrorism"" and maintain its support for the government.

Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Ankara would continue the operation it began in August targeting ISIL and Kurdish fighters.

Despite backing opposite sides in the conflict, Turkey and Russia have worked increasingly closely on Syria, brokering a deal this month to allow the evacuation of tens of thousands of civilians and rebel fighters from Aleppo.

UN peace envoy Staffan de Mistura has said he hoped the agreement would ""pave the way for productive talks"", but also reiterated he wants negotiations mediated by his office to continue next year.

The council held closed-door consultations on the text early Friday and Russia later amended the draft at the request of several member states.

The latest draft of the resolution, a copy of which was seen by AFP news agency, includes a reference to the talks being led by de Mistura."

The IFJ said on Friday the number included those killed in targeted attacks, bomb blasts or caught in the cross-fire. A further 29 died in plane crashes in Colombia and Russia.

Though the number is lower than previous years, the IFJ warned against complacency and continued impunity. Justice has been served for just four percent of journalists killed worldwide.

Countries with the highest numbers of media killings Iraq: 15 Afghanistan: 13 Mexico: 11 Yemen: 8 Guatemala 6 Syria: 6 India: 5 Pakistan: 5 Source: IFJ

""Any decrease in violence against journalist and media personnel is always welcome but these figures ... leave little room for comfort and reinforce hopes for the end of the security crisis in the media sector,"" Philippe Leruth, IFJ president, said in a statement.

""There cannot be impunity for these crimes.""

Regionally, the Middle East was deadliest with 30 killings, followed by Asia-Pacific with 28, Latin America with 24, Africa with eight and Europe with three, the watchdog said.

IFJ said it was aware that there many more journalists who had disappeared through the course of the year.

""The numbers could be higher, if it weren't for lack of credible information on these missing cases and for the self-censorship by journalists in some countries to avoid drawing the unwelcome attention of crime barons,"" added Anthony Bellanger, IFJ general secretary.

""There is, therefore, urgency in pressing governments to investigate all forms of violence, including killings and disappearances, in a speedy and credible manner to protect the physical integrity and professional independence of journalists.""

'Self-censorship'

The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), based in New York, said in a report earlier in December that impunity fostered acts of self-censorship. Many journalists were being intimidated into exile or being to forced withdraw from the field completely.

The CPJ cited the independent Pakistan Press Foundation, who in in November said: ""Threats and violence have forced many journalists to move from these danger zones and to leave the profession or to resort to self-censorship, particularly in conflict areas.""

The CPJ said Syria was the deadliest country for journalists in 2016, followed by Iraq and Yemen.

The number of journalists who have been killed in Syria since the war began in 2011 is now at least 107."

The Security Council met behind closed doors for an hour on Friday to consider a proposed resolution endorsing the ceasefire that Russia and Turkey announced on Thursday.

Al Jazeera has obtained the draft document, which provides details of the ceasefire and the planned peace negotiations.

According to the document, the armed opposition is committed to forming a delegation independently by January 16, 2017, and to attending the planned peace negotiations with the government in Kazakhstan's capital, Astana, on January 23, 2017.

The Syrian government delegation will take part in joint meetings with the opposition starting from January 15, 2017, in Astana, in which the UN will participate, the document says.

It is not clear whether a difference in the dates of the two delegations joining the negotiations was meant to be different or was a typo in the draft.

A UN vote is possible as early as Saturday, although Security Council members recommended changes to the draft and it will probably be revised, Vitaly Churkin, Russia's ambassador, said after the closed-door meeting.

""I think those accommodations can be easily absorbed into the draft,"" he said.

It was not immediately clear if the resolution would win broad support.

READ MORE: Clashes erupt near Damascus despite truce

Meanwhile, there is confusion over which Syrian opposition groups are covered by the ceasefire.

The Syrian government says the agreement does not include the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) group; fighters from al-Qaeda's former branch, al-Nusra Front; and factions linked to these armed groups.

But several rebel officials said on Thursday that the agreement did include the former al-Nusra Front - now known as Jabhat Fateh al-Sham - which announced in July that it was severing ties with al-Qaeda.

For its part, the Jabhat Fateh al-Sham has criticised the ceasefire for not mentioning President Bashar al-Assad's fate, and said the political solution under this agreement would ""reproduce the criminal regime"".

""The solution is to topple the criminal regime militarily,"" a spokesman for the fighters said in a statement on Friday.

Ahrar al-Sham, another powerful opposition armed group, says it has not signed the ceasefire agreement because of ""reservations"" but has not elaborated.

The United States, in the waning days of Barack Obama's administration, has been sidelined in recent negotiations and is not due take part in the Astana talks.

Russia has said the US could join a fresh peace process once Donald Trump takes office as president on January 20.

It also wants Egypt to join, together with Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Iraq, Jordan and the US.

Trump has said he will cooperate more closely with Russia on counterterrorism measures.

However, it is unclear what that policy will look like, given resistance from the Pentagon and the US intelligence community to closer cooperation with Russia on Syria."

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) reported fighting early on Friday between troops and rebels in the central province of Hama and near the capital, Damascus.

The SOHR, a UK-based information office which documents human-rights abuses in Syria, also reported an aerial attack on the rebel-held Wadi Barada valley near Damascus.

Mazen al-Shami, an opposition activist from the Damascus suburb of Douma, said minor clashes nearby left one rebel fighter wounded during the day.

READ MORE: Russia seeks UN endorsement of Syria ceasefire

Separately, Ahmad al-Masalmeh, an activist in Deraa province, accused government forces of opening fire on rebel-held areas.

Al Jazeera has learnt that five people have been killed in violence in the first 24 hours since the ceasefire took effect at 22:00 GMT.

Given that several past UN-backed attempts at halting the fighting in Syria have failed, it remains to be seen whether the current one, backed by Russia and Turkey, will succeed.

'Major breakthrough'

Al Jazeera's Hashem Ahelbarra, reporting from Turkey's Gaziantep near the Syria border, said periodic clashes in some parts of Syria were reported just hours after the ceasefire went into effect.

However, the fact that the truce is largely holding amounts to a ""major breakthrough"" and could pave the way for a final political settlement, he said.

""There are some sporadic clashes around Damascus in Wadi Barada and Deraa and in Aleppo, but activists operating on the ground say calm still prevails, which is a significant development,"" he said.

Russia announced on Thursday a deal it said had been accepted by seven of Syria's major rebel factions, though none of them immediately confirmed it, and one denied signing it.

As with the previous agreements, the current ceasefire excludes the Jabhat Fateh al-Sham, which earlier had links to al-Qaeda, and the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) group.

Assad-Putin conversation

Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Thursday that the ceasefire would be guaranteed by both his country and Turkey.

And on Friday Russian officials said Syrian President Bashar al-Assad had conveyed his commitment to observing the truce during a phone call with Putin.

Assad is reported to have agreed that the planned peace talks in Kazakhstan would be an ""important step"" in resolving the conflict.

Assad also met a joint delegation from the European and Russian parliaments although it is not clear if the meeting took place before or after Thursday's deal was sealed.

Russia and Iran provide crucial military support to Assad, while Turkey has long served as a rear base and source of supplies for opposition factions.

Mohammad Javad Zarif, Iran's foreign minister, called the ceasefire a ""major achievement"" on Twitter on Friday.

""Let's build on it by tackling the roots of extremist terror,"" he said.

Qatar, which backs the Syrian rebels, also offered its full support to the ceasefire.

Nevertheless, Mohammed bin Jassim Al Thani, Qatar's foreign minister, called for continued dialogue and cautioned against fresh air strikes by the Syrian government.

The ceasefire deal followed a Russian-Turkish agreement earlier this month to evacuate the last rebels from eastern Aleppo after they were confined to a tiny enclave by a government offensive.

The retaking of all of Aleppo marked Assad's biggest military victory since the start of the 2011 uprising against his family's four-decade rule.

""The defeat of the terrorists in Aleppo is an important step towards ending the war,"" Assad told TG5, an Italian TV station, in a recent interview.

However, the capture of the city does not mean that the war has ended, he said, because ""terrorists"" are still in Syria."

The tragic image of five-year-old Omran Daqneesh, sitting in an ambulance after being pulled from a building hit by an air strike in Aleppo, less than a year after three-year old Aylan Kurdi was washed ashore in Turkey, made it clear that nothing will make a difference.

Five thousand more refugees drowned in the Mediterranean in 2016. And the lucky ones, like the hundred thousand-plus refugees who crossed the Red Sea from the Horn of Africa this year, have actually found refuge in war-torn Yemen!

And something else happened in 2016; something that didn't figure in the long lists of the end-of-the-year reviews; something that went beyond violence, beyond suffering. It's the year that added insult to injury, as disagreement translated into indecency, and arrogance bred incivility. It's the year of lies and post-truth.

A year of insolence

The Jewish Talmud lists a number of signs that that signal the end of times. For example, chutzpah or insolence will increase, the truth will be hidden, and the face of a generation, that is to say, its leaders, will be as the face of a dog.

Coincidentally, I've been hearing a lot of barking in recent times, coming from the most likely and, indeed, the most unlikely places.

The Talmud's face of a dog appearing on the horizon, like Shakespeare's ""let slip the dogs of war"", comes when leaders wreak havoc on the world. And just as dogs march ahead of their master, but are in fact being led from behind, so the leaders will only appear to be leading; in reality they will be following the whims of the masses and their worst instincts.

There are countless examples of such arrogance, recklessness and myopia. Here are three specific examples of chutzpah in 2016.

'The Syrian people have triumphed'

Five years after people accumulated victories in the struggle for freedom and justice in the Arab world, they now only count their losses.

The tide began to turn three years ago when the regimes cracked down on popular upheavals with impunity, choking the spirit of the Arab Spring amid mounting foreign meddling. It started with Libya and Syria, followed by Egypt and Yemen, and shows no signs of ebbing this year.

As moderates lingered in jails and cemeteries, moderation gave way to extremism, which in turn became the new norm that would come to shape 2016. New extremist groups such as the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant and al-Qaeda took to the fore, destroying all that was left from the Arab Spring.

The ""birth pangs of a new Middle East"" have continued to grow, but there is little evidence of the birth of a new Middle East.

Nowhere is this more evident than in Syria. Helped by Russia, Iran and various militias, the Assad regime destroyed much of the country under the pretext of fighting terrorism.

As the Syrian death toll rose to several hundreds of thousands, Bashar al-Assad, who in 2011 claimed that Syrians would never rise against the regime, boasted against the backdrop of falling Aleppo: ""The Syrian people have won.""

'Lies like a dog'

And just when you thought things couldn't get any worse, Donald Trump was elected US president. Those who were disappointed by Barrack Obama's under-reach are infuriated by the president-elect's overreach.

His incitement against Muslims is unprecedented, advocating a ban on Muslim travel to America and the creation of a registry for American Muslims by Homeland Security.

Trump has already made friends and allies from among some of the most notorious racists in the United States and beyond and has brought a number of Muslim and Arab haters to the White House as senior advisers.

2016 doesn't signal the end of times. There's still lots of time to do the right thing, to follow our moral compass, not our fears, celebrate hope and birth, and reverse this year's embrace and even reward for insolence, indecency, and incivility.

A bragger who ""lies"", according to The Washington Post and New York Times, Trump boasted to know more about ISIL ""than the US generals"", and that only he ""can protect America"", but then he argued it's best to leave it to the Russians and Syrian regime to finish the job. The job as described above.

Even before entering the White House, Trump has been making allies with the likes of Russia's Vladimir Putin, Egypt's Abdel Fattah el-Sisi as well as Israel's Benjamin Netanyahu. Even President Assad reckons they'll be allies.

And to top it all, after claiming that he would be neutral on Israel and Palestine, Trump promised to move the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem and assigned his campaign advisers, the ultra-Zionists David Friedman and Jason Greenblatt, as diplomatic envoys to Israel and to the ""peace talks"". The latter once served as a guard at an Israeli settlement.

So now the commander-in-tweet, who boasted of being the only one capable of resolving the conflict, threatens to punish the United Nations for approving a resolution condemning the illegal Israeli settlements and vowing to stop US disdain of Israel.

'Declaration of war'

OK, just to be clear, if anyone disdained anyone in this relationship, there is an overwhelming international consensus, except in Israel, that it is Netanyahu that has treated Obama with disdain, not the other way around.

Despite ""unprecedented"" US military and intelligence cooperation with Israel; despite granting it a record package of military aid of $38bn over the next 10 years; despite vetoing the UN Security Council resolution condemning the Israel illegal settlement in 2011 - the only veto the US used at the council on that year; and despite blocking all diplomatic pressures on Israel at various international forums, Netanyahu persisted in railing against and humiliating the Obama administration.

Otherwise, known as ""biting the hand that feeds you"".

OPINION: Israel's never-ending crimes - It's not just settlements

Nowhere was this clearer than when he colluded with Republican leaders of Congress to speak out against US diplomacy on the Iran nuclear deal. The president was informed only hours before Netanyahu's speech.

Meanwhile, Israeli officials have chastised their US counterparts as if they were the representatives of a banana republic. One called Obama's politics anti-Semitic, and John Kerry a man with the brain of a 12-year-old.

But the Secretary of State has been unrelenting. And this week he delivered a long speech defending US abstention during the Security Council vote on the resolution condemning the illegal Israeli settlement.

The 14 out of 15 majority in favour of the resolution was followed by an almost unprecedented cheer and applause. But the Obama administration has had to defend itself non-stop under a barrage of attacks and disinformation by Israel and its friends, including the most vocal, Donald Trump.

After all, in the words of one Israeli minister, supporting such a resolution is tantamount to supporting the 9/11 attacks, or, as Prime Minister Netanyahu menaced his New Zealand counterpart, it's ""declaration of war"" on Israel. A declaration of war! Oh, what chutzpah!

The dogs bark, but the caravan goes on

Syrian, Iranians, Russians and others have little or no choice. Insisting on better leadership has proved deadly. But what about Americans and Israelis! What is their excuse?

Yes, there is a lot of insolence out there, but rest assured, 2016 doesn't signal the end of times. There's still lots of time to do the right thing, to follow our moral compass, not our fears, celebrate hope and birth, and reverse this year's embrace and even reward for insolence, indecency, and incivility.

OPINION: What went wrong? A withering West

Say goodbye 2016, hello 2017. Wishing only that next year will be the year when ethics guide politics, not the other way around. Wishful thinking? Perhaps. But isn't that what we do on New Year's Eve?

Remember, as I always say: ""In the end, everything will be OK. If it's not OK, it's not the end.""

The dogs bark, but the caravan must go on.

PS: Dear dog lovers, The New York Times columnist and author of The Year of Voting Dangerously, Maureen Dowd, commented in her October 8 piece, Donald Goes to the Dogs: ""Given that Trump has dubbed so many women dogs, there's poetic justice in comparing him to one … But it's not fair to compare Trump to a dog. Dogs are awesome."" Her words, not mine.

It remains to be seen if the agreement would take effect and hold, with Russia and Turkey pledging to guarantee the ceasefire, which was due to begin at Thursday midnight local time.

Previous UN-backed attempts to end the Syrian civil war, which started as a largely unarmed uprising against President Bashar al-Assad in March 2011, have failed and often led to fierce fighting.

Al Jazeera's Charles Stratford, reporting from Gaziantep in Turkey near the Syria border, said: ""There are some serious questions being asked about one opposition group in particular that is considered a terrorist organisation - Jabhat Fateh al-Sham - which has been very successful in its battles against the Syrian regime.""

Inside Story: Syria war crimes probe - Will anyone be charged?

Earlier in the day, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced that an agreement had been reached on a countrywide ceasefire for Syria, with Russia and Turkey to act as guarantors.

He said the truce would begin at midnight on Thursday (22:00 GMT) and be followed by peace talks between the Syrian government and the opposition in Kazakhstan's capital, Astana.

Sergei Shoigu, Russia's defence minister, said the ceasefire would include 62,000 opposition fighters across Syria.

Russia launched its air war in support of Assad's forces in September 2015, marking a major turning point in the Syrian government's fight against armed opposition groups.

Trilateral agreement

A statement carried on Thursday by Syria's state news agency SANA said the truce agreement excluded the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) group, Jabhat Fateh al-Sham, the group formerly known as al-Nusra Front, and ""groups linked to them"", without specifying who these groups are.

Al Jazeera's Natasha Ghoneim, reporting from Moscow, said that three different documents had been signed as part of a trilateral agreement involving Russia, Turkey and Iran.

""The first document lays out an agreement between the Syrian government and opposition groups on the ground,"" she said.

""The second document includes measures designed to control the ceasefire, and the third lays out what needs to happen next in order for there to be peace talks.""

The Turkish foreign ministry confirmed the news of the ceasefire and called on countries with influence on the groups fighting in Syria to provide the necessary support for the ceasefire to last.

""Russia and Turkey strongly support the truce and will monitor it together,"" the ministry said.

Speaking in the Turkish capital Ankara later on Thursday, representatives of Syria's High Negotiations Committee (HNC) said the rebels would abide by the truce but would retaliate against violations by Syrian government forces and their allies.

The HNC is an umbrella group representing Syria's political and armed opposition factions, including the Free Syrian Army (FSA).

No direct talks

Usama Abu Zeyd, the FSA's spokesman, said the rebels had had no direct talks with the Syrian government or Iran during the truce talks and insisted that Assad would have no place in the future of Syria.

""The ceasefire covers all the territories of Syria and it extends to include all the groups fighting under the Syrian armed opposition,"" he said, adding that the rebels had agreed to start peace talks.

Abu Zeyd confirmed that the truce excluded ISIL, also known as ISIS, and the main Syrian Kurdish armed group, the Kurdish Popular Protection Units (YPG), but did not specify whether Jabhat Fateh al-Sham was also excluded.

Though the ceasefire is being described as ""nationwide"", fighting could very well continue in the areas under the control of ISIL and the other groups excluded from the ceasefire - Idlib, in the northwest, and the outskirts of Damascus, for instance.

Al Jazeera's Hashem Ahelbarra, also reporting from Gaziantep, said excluding Jabhat Fateh al-Sham could ""create some problems"" and ""further undermine the ceasefire's chances of holding"".

The group ""has presence in areas where moderate rebel groups are operating - around Aleppo, Idlib and on the outskirts of Damascus.

""If the Russians and the Syrian government decide to target the positions of [Jabhat Fateh al-Sham], the potential for casualties among other groups is going to be high"".

Syrian government forces and allied paramilitaries entered the eastern part of Aleppo city a week ago after the last residents and opposition fighters were evacuated from the enclave under a Turkish-Russian deal.

The pull-out gave Assad's forces full control over Aleppo, which had been divided between his government and opposition fighters since 2012.

Cautionary note

In his announcement from Moscow, Putin sounded a cautionary note, making it clear that the ceasefire deal was a work in progress.

""The agreements reached are, no doubt, very fragile and they demand special attention and follow-up in order to keep them and develop them,"" he said.

""Now we need to do everything for these agreements to work, so that negotiators would come to Astana and would begin to work on real peace process. I call on the Syrian government, armed opposition, all countries involved to support these agreements.""

Nour Hallak, a civil society activist based in Idlib, said there is some ""hope"" among Syrians because the latest ceasefire ""includes all the factions"".

READ MORE: Idlib overwhelmed by influx of Aleppo's wounded

""When we started to hear about the ceasefire, we felt that it may be for real this time,"" he told Al Jazeera by Skype, alluding to the previous failed truce attempts.

In a statement on Thursday, Staffan de Mistura, the UN special envoy to Syria, said he ""welcomes"" the ceasefire deal and expressed hope that it will ""will save civilian lives, facilitate the delivery of humanitarian assistance across Syria, and pave the way for productive talks in Astana"".

De Mistura estimated in April that more than 400,000 Syrians had been killed since 2011.

Calculating a precise death toll is difficult, partially owing to the forced disappearances of tens of thousands of Syrians whose fates remain unknown.

Almost 11 million Syrians - half the country's prewar population - have been displaced from their homes."

While the truce was standing in most parts of the country, some fighting broke out near a Christian town in central Hama province between rebels and Syrian government, according to a monitoring group.

""Fierce clashes took place between the two sides pushing regime forces to withdraw from a hill near Maharda,"" Abdel Rahman, head of the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, told AFP news agency.

""Small rebel groups and armed loyalists are seeking to destroy the truce because it puts an end to their presence,"" he said.

In a report on Thursday, the monitor said major provinces witnessed ""a calm atmosphere"" in the first hours of the ceasefire.

Elsewhere, the Turkish military said on Friday that Russia carried out three air strikes against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL, also known as ISIS) group near al-Bab, killing at least 12 ISIL fighters.

At least one Turkish soldier was killed in an attack on ISIL in northern Syria, Turkey's army added, claiming that its air strikes killed another 26 ISIL fighters in al-Bab and Daglabash. ISIL is excluded from the ceasefire.





The ceasefire agreement, hailed by Syria's government as a ""real opportunity"" to find a political solution to the war, comes a week after government forces recaptured the city of Aleppo in a major blow to rebel forces.

Russia and Turkey back opposing sides in the conflict, and the ceasefire does not involve the United States, which has negotiated previous ceasefires with Moscow.

A statement carried on Thursday by Syria's state news agency SANA said the truce, as well as excluding ISIL, also leaves out fighters from Jabhat Fateh al-Sham, and ""groups linked to them"".

Al Jazeera's Charles Stratford, reporting from Gaziantep on the Turkish border with Syria, said ""there are high hopes that this [truce] might work, but there are huge potential problems with it. The biggest seems to be this group - Jabhat Fateh al-Sham"".

""There are fears that if there are air strikes targeting"" Jabhat Fateh al-Sham, which has often fought alongside a number of signatories to the agreement, ""then there may be some casualties"" among those factions as well.

Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu said seven opposition groups, including the powerful Ahrar al-Sham, had signed the deal and those who failed to adhere would be considered ""terrorists"".

Usama Abu Zeyd, the Free Syrian Army (FSA) spokesman, said that the rebels had held no direct talks with the Syrian government or Iran during the truce talks and insisted that President Bashar al-Assad would have no place in the future of Syria.

""The ceasefire covers all the territories of Syria and it extends to include all the groups fighting under the Syrian armed opposition,"" he said, adding that the rebels had agreed to start peace talks.

The agreement comes after Turkey and Russia also brokered a deal to allow the evacuation of tens of thousands of civilians and rebel fighters from Aleppo.

""Now we need to do everything for these agreements to come into force, for them to work, so that the negotiating teams that have been or are being formed promptly and as soon as possible arrive in Astana,"" Russian President Vladimir Putin said.

United Nations peace envoy Staffan de Mistura said he hoped the agreement would ""pave the way for productive talks"" in Kazakhstan, but also reiterated he wants negotiations mediated by his office to continue early next year.

Turkey has long backed Syria's opposition, and its relations with Russia soured last year after Ankara shot down a Russian warplane.

But the two countries have worked closely of late on Syria, and Turkey was conspicuously quiet as Assad's forces retook Aleppo.

Syria's civil war, which began when a peaceful uprising descended into violence in 2011, has, according to the UN resulted in more than 400,000 deaths and displaced over 11 million people, half its prewar population.

He did not say how many troops and weapons would be withdrawn, but said Russia would continue ""fighting international terrorism in Syria"" and would maintain its presence at both an airbase in the coastal province of Latakia and the naval facility in the port of Tartus.

The Syrian conflict started as a largely unarmed uprising against Assad in March 2011, but quickly developed into a full-on armed civil war.

Turkey's state-run Anadolu news agency had reported on Wednesday that a ceasefire plan had been submitted to Syria's rival parties and could come into force as early as midnight.

But the coalition, which represents the Free Syrian Army and other rebel groups fighting across the country, told Al Jazeera that it was yet to receive a draft of the document.

Labib Nahhas, the foreign relations head of the powerful Ahrar al-Sham rebel group, said the faction was ""aware of ongoing discussions between Russia and Turkey about a nationwide ceasefire"".

He said rebel factions had not been presented with any official proposal.

""Russia wants to exclude Eastern Ghouta from the ceasefire, which is not acceptable,"" he told the AFP news agency, referring to a rebel-held area outside Damascus.

Meanwhile, sources told Al Jazeera that a new meeting was planned in Ankara on Thursday, this time between Syrian rebels, Turkey and Russia.

Mevlut Cavusoglu, Turkey's foreign minister, told broadcaster A Haber in an interview that Ankara was aiming to establish the ceasefire before the new year.

Al Jazeera's Charles Stratford, reporting from Gaziantep in neighbouring Turkey, said it remained unclear which opposition groups had been taking part in previous negotiations.

""A senior official from the Free Syrian Army says that the FSA has rejected a proposal by Russia that Douma, one of its strongholds near the capital Damascus, would not be included in the ceasefire agreement,"" Stratford said.

OPINION: Who are we to say the Syrian revolution is dead?

On Wednesday, a source requesting anonymity had told Anadolu that ""terrorist organisations"" would be excluded from the deal.

This would most certainly exclude the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) group and Jabhat Fateh al-Sham, the group formerly known as al-Nusra Front.

If successful, the latest proposal could form the basis for upcoming political negotiations between Damascus and the opposition, overseen by Russia and Turkey in the Kazakh capital Astana, Anadolu added.

Ankara has hosted a succession of closed-door talks between Russia and Syrian opposition rebels over the past weeks.

Ankara and Moscow have been on opposing sides in the Syrian civil war, with Turkey seeking to oust President Bashar al-Assad, who is backed by Russia and Iran.

Or did it?

Although the UN Security Council, with rare uniformity, chastised Israel for flouting the law of occupation, the resolution, crafted with ambiguous lawyerly precision, left experienced thinkers on the subject debating just what it means.

In its most ambitious read, some would argue it appears that the decree concerned the occupation as a whole, and swept within its prohibitive reach all settlement activity since 1967 when Israel seized the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, from Arab-Palestinian control.

Others view its advisory language as helpful through its continued embrace of the time-tired two-state solution and its apparent call for a return to the status quo ante of some 15 years ago when illegal settlements had not as yet swallowed much more than 60 percent of the West Bank.

In its least appealing landscape painting, it would appear that the resolution seemingly bestows upon already completed settlements de facto legitimacy and addresses only that part of the building glut currently under way or planned for tomorrows yet to come.

To make matters worse, despite its gratuitous dicta, the resolution remains very much a toothless declaration without any enforcement mechanism whatsoever - essentially relying upon a sudden burst of Israeli conscience to reverse a steady march of indifference to international law that has led Israel's way since the very first day it was manufactured from stolen land in Palestine.

Defiant Netanyahu

Predictable in immediacy and urgency, the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu threw his weekly tantrum, accusing the world of a dark conspiracy organised by the soon to be ex-President of the United States, Barack Obama, who on his way out of the door after years of obsequious obedience to Israeli will, has suddenly discovered that it's OK to say no ... well ... maybe ... or perhaps, to its glaring intransigence.

But then again, it's kind of hard to take seriously ""pressure"" exerted by a country that has just enriched Israel's military coffers and occupation to the tune of $38bn.

Not satisfied with the echo of his own vitriol, Netanyahu was just beginning. Next, he singled out Senegal - one of the most impoverished countries in the world and a mover of the resolution - for economic reprisal. Its offence is having the temerity to believe in the rule of law and being housed in the international building with flags of 193 nations and the State of Palestine that sits overlooking the East River of New York City.

Netanyahu told the world just what he thinks of the UN and its resolution when he announced plans to proceed with the building of thousands of new housing units in Jerusalem in particular.

""Israel will not turn its other cheek,"" Netanyahu proclaimed as he went on to prophesy a ""plan of action"" against the UN directly. Not long thereafter he suspended working ties with the UK, France, Russia, China, Japan, Ukraine, Angola, Egypt, Uruguay, Spain, Senegal and New Zealand, those countries that supported the resolution.

Like a dark lord

Netanyahu should quit while he's ahead, but he just can't. There is no incentive. Like the hundreds of earlier resolutions critical of Israeli policies, as worded, the most recent condemnation by the UN can do little more than cry out for justice in the night from a state built from the marrow of genocide.

I get ""bombast"", ""brash"" and, at times, even ""bully"". However, it's the two-legged beasts that feed on the innocent I do not. Netanyahu is very much that kind of beast - an ogre who lives in a world surrounded by dark, deadly thoughts. With delusion his ally, dishonesty his friend and death his messenger, he thumbs his nose at the world as his reign of state terror consumes more and more civilian victims guilty of no offence other than breathing the air that surrounds them and seeking a free life.

When the history of our times is written, an honest accounting will no doubt add Netanyahu's wicked shadow - and that of his predecessors - to the list of fiends that have seen the world as little more than a playground within which to use their toys of death and despair - always, of course, for the right reasons and always, of course, against the meek and defenceless among us.

The sum total of Israel's efforts these past 68 years is nothing short of the deliberate infliction upon Palestinians, as a cognizable group, conditions of life and death calculated to bring about their physical destruction in whole or in part.

In the world of Joseph Stalin, induced famine was the prime weapon of choice, though mass execution and exile helped him dispose of tens of millions he viewed as ""enemies of the people"".

To Henry Kissinger, the world, particularly Indochina, was very much a small chess game. Civilians were mere pawns ripe for sacrifice through hi-tech weaponry, including biological and chemical warfare, to enforce his worldview at any cost. Millions lost their lives to his cerebral game board.

To Pol Pot, struggle was little more than purification, erasing through starvation, overwork and execution a quarter of his people whose sole crime was to see life through a prism that collided with his own - no matter how soft their view or backward his sight.

In Rwanda up to half a million women were sexually assaulted, mutilated or murdered, along with an equal number of male Tutsis, as enemy agents of the Hutu state - machetes and rape induced Aids to the plentiful weapons of preference.

Slow-motion genocide

These are but a few of the extremes of genocide, those rare cases we are told noted mostly for mass murder, systemic rape or group starvation - the worst of the worst. Yet, genocide does not demand of us an immediate mountain of bodies or an explosive rage of terror for international law to take hold.

As it turns out, in what increasingly seems to be more than mere passing coincidence, the legal definition of ""genocide"" enacted by the UN General Assembly was born in 1948, the very same year as Israel - which has since gone on to become both expert at its application and legendary in its denial.

In relevant part, under the applicable Convention, genocide means ""any of the following acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such: (a) killing members of the group; (b) causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group; or (c) deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part"". Each and every one of these types of genocide has been perpetrated by Israel, seemingly with almost proud boast, and no accountability, for almost 70 unbroken years.

One need not rest upon obtuse historical footnotes to find abundant, indeed systemic, acts of extermination carried out by Israel since 1948 against Palestinians - very much a cognizable ""national, ethnical, racial or religious group"" as those terms are contemplated and commonly understood and applied under international law.

OPINION: Barack Obama, John Kerry, and the Palestine saga

Beginning with its mass expulsion, rape and murder at the onset of the Nakba (the Catastrophe) Israel has devoted itself to 68 years of non-stop genocide coming up for air only periodically to retool or to change the nature of its weaponry of choice.

What started out with the expulsion, at gunpoint, of more than 700,000 Palestinians from their ancestral homeland set in motion a refugee stampede that has grown to more than seven million displaced and stateless people, providing the world more than a disturbing glimpse of what was to come decades later in Syria.

Never-ending violence

Over the years, Israel has found diverse ways to kill more than 400,000 Palestinian civilians and injure or cripple two to three times as many, including tens of thousands of women and children. Whether by tank fire, rockets, or cluster or phosphorus bombs, it has given new meaning to the evil of willful group slaughter.

In its thirst to ethnically cleanse all of Palestine of its remaining inhabitants, it has made use of starvation, in violation of Additional Protocol I to the 1949 Geneva Conventions, as a method of war targeting foodstuffs, crops and livestock throughout the occupied territories.

In particular, it has destroyed more than a million olive trees which not only serve as an essential mainstay of Palestinian culture but, along with hundreds of thousands of razed fruit trees, constitute key products of a Palestinian national economy largely in various states of ruin.

In Gaza, Israel has targeted hospitals, schools, daycare centres, multi-storey apartment complexes, UN Relief and Works Agency shelters and mental health clinics with a deadly proficiency that would make historic war criminals blush with envy.

It has laid waste to thousands of its hardscrabble built homes and left upwards of a hundred thousand Palestinians internally displaced, indeed homeless - leaving many families at a breaking point.

INTERACTIVE: Palestine Remix

For the survivors of the Gaza killing fields, Israel has made life unbearable over the past decade though a criminal embargo that not only guarantees insufficient caloric intake, fresh water and medicine, but denies to its 1.8 million survivors building materials essential for the reconstruction of its beleaguered, and largely levelled, infrastructure.

Not satisfied with physical pain alone, with cruel, wanton abandon, it is no stretch to find that its master plan has consciously induced levels of post-traumatic stress disorder unmatched anywhere else in the world.

Given all these palpable elements of ethnic cleansing, it is reasonably projected that Gaza will be uninhabitable by 2020 thereby once again driving several million traumatised refugees out on to the road of an uncertain and dangerous diaspora.

To describe Israel's Gaza strategy as anything but one intended to cause ""serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group"" is to deny a very public and systematic orgy of punishment meted out to Palestinian civilians on the basis of group identity and dynamic - and nothing more.

In the West Bank, Israel's calculus of pain and punishment is largely a difference without a distinction: one that varies in form but not intent or ultimate goal.

Not satisfied with the 531 villages and localities it depopulated and completely eradicated during the early days of the Nakba, since 1967 Israel has stolen, resettled and annexed almost all of the West Bank, including much of East Jerusalem, in clear violation of Article 4 of the Geneva Conventions which prohibit an occupation force from doing little more than erecting limited bases for its own security needs in occupied land.

During this criminal land grab, it has approved, indeed subsidized, the building of illegal housing for some 800,000 - largely immigrant - settlers at the same time it has destroyed almost 50,000 Palestinian structures, largely homes, many of them ages-old, rendering tens of thousands of its indigenous population homeless, often destitute or dependent upon the largesse of already overcrowded housing of family or friends.

Unaccountable as always

None of these facts about Israel's sordid and deadly history can be dispatched as the product of mere hyperbole or unsupported hearsay.

Claims of Israeli genocide have been substantiated time and time again by a host of independent human rights organisations and NGOs, with no axe to grind, and include findings from respected groups from within Israel, itself.

In point of fact, from its arrogant perch, Israel has not just committed unspeakable acts of genocide but done so with absolute transparency as if to say to the rest of the world: there we did it, and we are well beyond the reach of international law.

Make no mistake about it, the sum total of Israel's efforts these past 68 years is nothing short of the deliberate infliction upon Palestinians, as a cognizable group, conditions of life and death calculated to bring about their physical destruction in whole or in part.

OPINION: The UN settlement resolution is too little and too late

In the presence of overwhelming evidence of premeditated Israeli genocide, to argue otherwise is to reduce the dark, evil and systematic deeds of Stalin, Kissinger, Pol Pot and the Hutu state to little more than a collection of misunderstood happenstance.

Yes, Mr Prime Minister, you should quit while you are ahead. Today, Israel stands charged with violations of the law of occupation. Tomorrow, it might very well, indeed should, find itself seated in a well-deserved international dock on trial for genocide.

Turkey's state-run Anadolu news agency reported on Wednesday that a ceasefire plan had been submitted to Syria's rival parties and could come into force as soon as midnight (22:00 GMT).

Citing a source who requested anonymity, Anadolu said ""terrorist organisations"" would be excluded from the deal.

This would most certainly exclude the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) group and Jabhat Fateh al-Sham, the group formerly known as al-Nusra Front.

The source also said that if the ceasefire succeeded, political negotiations would start in the Kazakh capital, Astana, under Turkey and Russia's guidance.

Samir Nashar, a Syrian opposition figure, said that there were ""tremendous efforts being exerted by the Turkish government to implement such a ceasefire with the help of an Arab country"" before a proposed meeting takes place in Kazakhstan.

Labib Nahhas, foreign relations head for another rebel group, Ahrar al-Sham, confirmed to AFP news agency that the faction was ""aware of ongoing discussions between Russia and Turkey..."".

But he said that rebel factions had not been presented with any official proposal and said there were still obstacles to the deal.

""Russia wants to exclude Eastern Ghouta from the ceasefire, which is not acceptable,"" he said, referring to a rebel-held area outside Damascus.

Syria's army has been advancing in Eastern Ghouta in recent months, and securing the area around the Syrian capital would be another major government gain after recapturing Aleppo.

Al Jazeera's Hashem Ahelbarra, reporting from Gaziantep, in Turkey, near the Syria border, said the deal amounts to a ""major breakthrough"" and could pave the way for a final political settlement.

""Many rebel groups were instrumental during the deal. They were present during the talks between the Russian and Turks and principally agree with the terms,"" he said.

""But the political umbrella of the opposition is sceptical and says that armed groups should not have a say on major deals; the highest political organs should.

OPINION: A ceasefire in Syria is pure fantasy

""Having said that, this will just be phase one of the deal. Phase two will be the stitching together of a political settlement.

""But at the moment we still have two opposing views. The Turks say President Bashar al-Assad should have no rule in a future Syria, a condition which has been repeatedly dismissed by Russia in the past.

""So it still remains to be seen whether these two can overcome their differences and pave the way for a final political settlement.""

The foreign ministers of Turkey, Russia and Iran met last week in Moscow where they agreed to act as guarantor powers for a peace accord between the Assad government and the opposition.

'Children killed'

Amid the diplomatic developments, air strikes have killed at least 22 people, including 10 children, in a village in eastern Syria, according to a UK-based monitor.

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported on Wednesday that the raids hit the village of Hajna in Deir Az Zor province, killing 12 people from one family and 10 from another. It said at least 10 children were among the dead.

Local activists quoted online said the air strikes happened on Tuesday. Located in the northern countryside of Deir Az Zor, Hajna is held by ISIL, also known as ISIS.

The Syrian Observatory had no immediate word on who carried out the raids but it was likely to have been either the Assad government or its ally Russia.

The Syrian civil war started as a largely unarmed uprising against Assad in March 2011, but quickly developed into a full-on armed conflict.

Staffan de Mistura, the UN special envoy to Syria, estimated in April that more than 400,000 Syrians had been killed since 2011.

Calculating a precise death toll is difficult, partially owing to the forced disappearances of tens of thousands of Syrians whose fates remain unknown.

Almost 11 million Syrians - half the country's prewar population - have been displaced from their homes."

Russian fighter jets have been carrying out air raids over Syria in support of President Bashar al-Assad since September 2015.

As news of the deaths in Deir Az Zor emerged, the Turkish state news agency reported that Turkey and Russia had reached an agreement on a plan for a ceasefire comprising the whole of Syria.

Under the plan, Ankara and Moscow would work for the ceasefire to come into force at midnight on Wednesday, Anadolu reported, adding that ""terrorist groups"", such as ISIL, would be excluded.

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on Tuesday that he had evidence that US-led coalition forces give support to the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL, also known as ISIS) and Kurdish groups, namely the People's Protection Units (YPG) and the Democratic Union Party (PYD).

""They were accusing us of supporting Daesh,"" he told a press conference in Ankara, using the Arabic abbreviation for ISIL.

""Now they give support to terrorist groups including Daesh, YPG, PYD. It is very clear. We have confirmed evidence, with pictures, photos and videos,"" he said, without elaborating further about the evidence in question.

'Ludicrous' comments

The US state department dismissed Erdogan's claims as ""ludicrous"". Spokesman Mark Toner said there was no basis for such an accusation.

Galip Dalay, a columnist and analyst on Turkish and Kurdish affairs, said the sharp statement by Erdogan is an expression of disappointment in President Barack Obama’s Syria policy.

""Turkey believes that the Obama administration does not have the capability to hurt Turkey at this point,"" he told Al Jazeera.

""So, [Erdogan] is taking the liberty to use sharp rhetoric. Ankara has been expressing its expectations for the mutual relations to get better under the incoming Donald Trump administration,"" he said.

Dalay said he did not have any information on Washington's alleged support for ISIL, but added that both the US and Russia have been supporting Syrian Kurdish forces against ISIL.

He said Washington was doing this mainly through the Syrian Democratic Forces, a multi-ethnic rebel group mainly active in the north of Syria.

""Kurdish fighters are the backbone of the group,"" he said.

Dalay also stressed that Syrian Kurds, widely represented by the PYD, opened a representative office in Russia in 2016 and the two side have been in close cooperation.

Separately, Russia said on Tuesday that a US decision to ease restrictions on arming Syrian rebels paves the way for deliveries of shoulder-fired anti-aircraft missiles, a move it said would directly threaten Russian forces in the country.

Maria Zakharova, a Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman, said that the policy change - set out in the annual defence policy bill and signed into law by US President Barack Obama on December 23 - would lead to weapons ending up ""in the hands of jihadists with whom the sham 'moderate' opposition have long acted jointly.

""Such a decision is a direct threat to the Russian air force, to other Russian military personnel, and to our embassy in Syria, which has come under fire more than once. We therefore view the step as a hostile one,"" Zakharova said in a statement.

A provision in the National Defense Authorisation Act, Washington's defence policy bill, bars the US Defense Department from spending funds on anti-aircraft missiles for Syrian rebel groups until the secretaries of state and defence submit a report to congressional committees explaining the decision to do so.

The report would have to include which groups would receive the weapons, intelligence analyses on the groups and the kinds and numbers of anti-aircraft missiles to be supplied.

Reporting from Moscow, Al Jazeera's Natasha Ghoneim said Russia was ""lashing out"" at the US in the final days of Obama's administration.

""The [Russian] foreign ministry is saying that the Obama administration is trying to complicate the global situation ahead of Donald Trump, the president-elect, taking office,"" she said.

Campaign of air strikes

Throughout the Syrian civil war, the US has funded several Syrian rebel groups and provided them with logistical support and weapons.

Russia, on the other hand, launched a campaign of air strikes last year in support of President Bashar al-Assad and his forces to battle opposition groups, some of which are supported by the US.

Meanwhile, foreign ministers of Russia and Turkey agreed in a telephone conversation on Tuesday to push for a ceasefire in Syria and to prepare for peace talks planned in the Kazakh capital of Astana next month.

Iran will also take part in the Astana gathering, Russia's foreign ministry said, as Turkey called on its Gulf allies Saudi Arabia and Qatar to join the talks.

The Syrian opposition's main political body on Tuesday urged rebel groups to cooperate with ""sincere regional efforts"" to reach a ceasefire, but said it had not been invited to any conference, referring to the Kazakhstan meeting.

""We support the shifts in positions of some international powers and the positive, sincere efforts that could represent a starting point for realising the Syrian people's aspirations by reaching an agreement that brings security and stability,"" Riad Hijab, general coordinator for the High Negotiations Committee, said in a written statement distributed to the press."

Russia, on the other hand, launched a campaign of air strikes last year in support of President Bashar al-Assad and his government forces to battle the Syrian opposition groups, some of which are supported by the US.

Last week, the Syrian government recaptured previously rebel-held eastern Aleppo after an intense battle that led to the displacement of tens of thousands of civilians. Many other civilians were caught in the crossfire.

Zakharova accused the Obama administration of trying to ""put a mine"" under the incoming administration of Donald Trump by attempting to get it to continue what she called the ""anti-Russian line"" of the US.

Diplomatic efforts

The Russian Interfax news agency cited Sergey Lavrov, Russia's foreign minister, on Tuesday as saying that the Syrian government was taking part in talks - coordinated by Russia - with the opposition.

However, the reports have been rejected by some members of the Syrian opposition.

Al Jazeera's Hashem Ahelbarra, reporting from Gaziantep in Turkey near the border with Syria, said there is a clear attempt by the Russians, the Turks and the Iranians to find a political solution to the war, with talks possibly to be held in Kazakhstan.

The Syrian National Council , the political umbrella of the Syrian opposition groups, ""has distanced itself from the talks, saying that they so far have not met the Russians"", he said.

READ MORE: East Aleppo - Our memories are buried

""At the same time, there are many powerful armed groups which are involved in those talks,"" which shows there ""is a widening rift between the different Syrian factions"".

Meanwhile, the Syrian government along with its ally Hezbollah, the Lebanese armed group, has stepped up its efforts to take control of rebel-held Wadi Barada on the outskirts of the capital Damascus.

Dozens of civilians were reportedly killed in barrel-bomb attacks on the area on Monday.

The Wadi Barada valley, a mountainous area near the Lebanese border, has been under siege since 2014 with food, water and electricity all in short supply.

The area is crucial for the government as it contains a vital river supplying drinking water to Damascus.

The operation was launched after the Syrian government accused the rebels of contaminating the water with diesel.

The Syrian civil war started as a largely unarmed uprising against Assad in March 2011, but quickly developed into a full-on civil war.

Russian president Vladimir Putin went on television to declare Monday a nationwide day of mourning.

""We will conduct a thorough investigation into the reasons and will do everything to support the victims' families,"" Putin said.

Backed by ships, helicopters and drones, rescue teams have been searching for the victims of Sunday's crash.

All 84 passengers and eight crew members on board the plane operated by the Russian military are believed to have died when it crashed two minutes after taking off at 5:25am local time (02:25 GMT) in good weather from the southern Russian city of Sochi.

The Russian defence ministry said it had recovered 10 bodies by late Sunday.

Transport minister Maxim Sokolov, in charge of a state probe into the crash, said on state television that investigators were looking into a ""whole spectrum"" of theories on the cause of the crash of the Soviet-built Tu-154 plane.

When asked if a ""terror attack"" could have been behind the crash, Sokolov said: ""It is premature to speak of this.""

He added that the aircraft's black boxes had yet to be found.

More than 3,000 people - including over 100 divers flown in from across Russia - worked from 32 ships and several helicopters to search the crash site, the defence ministry said.

Drones and submersibles were also being used to help spot bodies and debris. Powerful spotlights were brought in so the search could continue around the clock.

Emergency crews found fragments of the plane about 1.5km from shore. By Sunday evening, rescue teams had recovered 11 bodies and Sokolov, the transport minister, said fragments of other bodies were also found.

Famous doctor, choir on board

The plane belonging to the defence ministry was taking its famed choir, the Alexandrov Ensemble, to a New Year's concert at Khmeimim airbase in Syria's coastal province of Latakia. Those on board also included nine Russian journalists and a Russian doctor famous for her work in war zones.

Yelizaveta Glinka has won wide acclaim for her charity work, which has included missions to war zones in eastern Ukraine and Syria. Her foundation said Glinka was accompanying a shipment of medicine for a hospital in Syria.

Syrian president Bashar al-Assad was among numerous foreign leaders who sent a condolence note to Putin, saying he received the news ""with deep grief and sadness"".

The Black Sea search area - which covered 10 square kilometres - was made more difficult by underwater currents that carried debris and body fragments into the open sea.

Minister Sokolov said the plane's flight recorders did not have the radio beacons common in more modern aircraft, so locating them on the seabed was going to be challenging.

The Tu-154 is a Soviet-built three-engine airliner designed in the late 1960s. More than 1,000 have been built, and they have been used extensively in Russia and worldwide.

The plane that crashed on Sunday was built in 1983, and underwent factory check-ups and maintenance in 2014 and earlier this year, according to the defence ministry.

Investigators are exploring a number of possible causes to the crash, ""including a catastrophic malfunction, a pilot error or a bird flying into the engine"", said Al Jazeera's Natasha Ghoneim, reporting from Moscow.

Russian planes have been brought down previously by attacks. In October 2015, a Russian plane carrying mostly Russian tourists back from vacation in Egypt was brought down by a bomb over the Sinai Peninsula, killing all 224 people aboard. The local affiliate of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) group claimed responsibility.

Tu-154

In recent years, Russian airlines have replaced their Tu-154s with more modern planes, but the military and other government agencies in Russia have continued to use them. While noisy and fuel-guzzling, the plane is popular with crews that appreciate its manoeuvrability and ruggedness.

Still, since 1994 there have been 17 major plane crashes involving the Tu-154 that have killed over 1,760 people. Most resulted from human error."

This New York Times dispatch is from 1903, from the Macedonian town of Bitola, where the Russian consul-general was assassinated by an Albanian member of the Ottoman army.

Macedonia's ethnic heterogeneity between Slavs, Greeks and Albanians had fallen victim to growing nationalism, enveloped between an assertive Russia and a declining Ottoman Empire.

By the early 1900s, assassinations of ambassadors and consuls based in the Ottoman Balkans became a substantial source of concern for the imperial administration, as the loyalties of the multi-ethnic and multi-religious Ottoman military and police forces wavered along with the changing power dynamics in the Balkans.

The Balkans' transition between two imperial powers had led to a rise of successive rebellions, which would eventually culminate with the Balkan Wars of 1912-13.

Yet, the 1903 assassination of the Russian consul-general endangered an earlier Balkan War, which would be postponed for a decade, after much political manoeuvring and diplomacy by Sultan Abdulhamid II.

Reminiscent of great power games of the past

Andrey Karlov, the Russian Ambassador to Turkey who was killed on December 19 is the first assassinated ambassador in Turkey since the foundation of the republic in 1923.

Having been assigned to Ankara in 2013, Karlov took over an increasingly difficult job with a tense portfolio, and presided over one of the most difficult episodes in Turkey-Russia relations in recent history, playing a key role in the improvement of relations since the Turkish shooting-down of the Russian jet in November 2015.

As another chapter of the Syrian civil war is being carried out brutally in eastern Aleppo, the flammable combination of great power interests and local, non-state, armed groups' willingness to go on fighting, isn't too far off from the conditions of 1903-1913.

While the World War I or Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria analogies that spread across the social media following the assassination of Ambassador Karlov may seem interesting initially, they ultimately forget the fact that Turko-Russian geopolitical competition goes far back to the 18th century.

Despite Russia's support for the Turkish government in the aftermath the failed coup attempt in July and both parties' emerging cooperation in Syria, there is little Russia and Turkey can do for each other beyond Syria and ongoing energy, tourism and trade partnership.

Even further, the current state of affairs between Russia and Turkey resemble more to 1903 than 1914, and Syria of today, looks more like the Macedonia of a century ago - similar powers, interests and peripheral reactions.

The 1903 assassination had led to a wider range of Ottoman concessions to Russia, partly to do with the diplomatic embarrassment over the incident and mostly to do with the piling Russian navy in the Black Sea.

Sultan Abdulhamid II even followed the trial of the Albanian soldier closely, making sure that he received the death penalty. Despite that, Turks entered the World War I when the Ottoman-German navies bombarded Sevastopol, the primary Russian naval port in the Black Sea.

No need for alarmism

Alarmism over ""a new World War III"" is largely unfounded, at least with regards to Turkey, Russia or Syria.

Although Syria is the high school reunion of the belligerents of World War I, the dynamics at play in Syria and Iraq (or Aleppo and Mosul) are more local (sectarian-historical) than international.

If anything, the assassination of Karlov will have a similar impact to the downing of the Russian jet in November 2015 - bringing Moscow and Ankara closer (or render Ankara more dependent on Moscow in security affairs).

After the 1903 killing, the amount of ethnic tension within the Ottoman army and local security forces had alarmed other embassies in Constantinople, who feared similar attacks and called upon their respective navies to dock their warships on the Bosphorus to protect their personnel.

Eventually, the rift within the Ottoman military, threat on foreign heads of mission and the European view that the empire could no longer afford a slow decline, resulted in a direct German command and training influence by 1909, uniting the Ottoman ranks enough to fight one last time in World War I.

Today, however, it is unlikely and difficult for Russia to exert a similar influence over the Turkish military. Despite Russia's support for the Turkish government in the aftermath the failed coup attempt in July and both parties' emerging cooperation in Syria, there is little Russia and Turkey can do for each other beyond Syria and ongoing energy, tourism and trade partnership.

Turkey has long used its improving relations with Russia as a lever towards attaining better negotiating terms with the European Union and strengthening its position in NATO. Turkey's real focus has always been these two institutions, regardless of what Turkish officials say in heated public rallies.

OPINION: Turkey's move against Russia - Cold War redux?

Although this assassination is a significant second blow to Turkish-Russian relations after the downing of the Russian jet, it is unlikely to impair these relations. Assessments of a World War III or analogies of Archduke Franz Ferdinand are also quite out of proportion.

If anything, it will increase intelligence and security partnership between the two countries. Yet, the incident impairs Ankara's ability to diplomatically pressure Russia either on the Aleppo evacuation, or its aftermath, or the role of Iran in post-war Syria.

And finally, it opens up more extensive pressuring channels for Moscow to force Ankara to end any and all proxy relations in Syria, effectively cutting off Ankara from Aleppo or its aftermath.

The council unanimously adopted the French-drafted resolution that marks the first show of unity in months among world powers grappling with the crisis in Syria.

The resolution calls for UN officials and others to be able to monitor evacuations from eastern Aleppo and the safety of civilians who remain in the Syrian city.

The 15-member council resolution ""demands all parties to provide these monitors with safe, immediate and unimpeded access"".

Al Jazeera's Mike Hanna, reporting from the UN headquarters in New York, said: ""For the first time in numerous attempts to get unanimity on the situation on Aleppo, all of the 15 UN Security Council members have supported this resolution to send UN monitors in Aleppo.""

Russia had vetoed six similar resolutions before this one.

""What happens next is deployment of UN and aid organisation personnel to Aleppo,"" Hanna said.

Evacuations resume after shaky start

Syria's UN ambassador, Bashar Jaafari, decried the resolution. He said that while Syria does not oppose UN Security Council resolutions that respect international humanitarian law, the resolution was ""just another part of the continued propaganda against Syria and its fight against terrorists"".

He added that ""the last terrorists in some districts of the eastern part of Aleppo are evacuating their strongholds and Aleppo this evening will be clean"".

Dozens of buses carrying evacuees including orphaned children from the last rebel-held district of Aleppo travelled to opposition-controlled areas outside the city early on Monday, according to Turkish officials and a monitoring group.

OPINION: Reporting from the ground in times of war

Turkey said that about 20,000 people have been evacuated from eastern Aleppo so far, as a fragile ceasefire between rebels and government forces was holding.

Turkish foreign minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said on Monday that the evacuees from the besieged city were bused to an area under opposition control, in an ongoing effort to get people to safety.

Meanwhile, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said an estimated 500 people had been evacuated from two villages besieged by rebels in Idlib province on Monday as part of the deal.

SOHR said 10 buses had left the majority Shia towns of Foua and Kefraya carrying evacuees through rebel-held territory towards Aleppo.

The evacuation process in Aleppo got off to a shaky start last week, with agreements collapsing and four people reportedly killed by government-allied forces as they attempted to leave eastern Aleppo.

Nearly 50 children who were trapped in an orphanage in east Aleppo were evacuated, the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) said.

""This morning, all 47 children trapped in an orphanage in east Aleppo were evacuated to safety, with some in critical condition from injuries and dehydration,"" Geert Cappelaere, UNICEF regional director, said in a statement.

UNICEF and other agencies were also assisting in reunifying other children evacuated in the past few days with their families and giving them medical care and winter clothes, he said.

Meanwhile, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said an estimated 500 people had been evacuated from two villages besieged by rebels in Idlib province on Monday as part of the deal.

'Sleeping in the streets'

Thousands of people remain in eastern Aleppo, many sleeping in the streets in freezing temperatures as they wait to be evacuated.

""Conditions in eastern Aleppo remain extremely dire,"" said Al Jazeera's Imtiaz Tyab, reporting from Gaziantep on the Turkey-Syria border.

""In the evenings it can go to -5C. They have access to very little food, fuel, water and medical supplies.""

Most of the evacuees are taken to rebel-held Idlib province or Aleppo countryside.

Turkey has said that they could also be housed in a camp to be built near the Turkish border to the north.

UN monitors

Meanwhile at the United Nations, France and Russia announced agreement on a compromise resolution to deploy UN monitors to eastern Aleppo to ensure safe evacuations and immediate delivery of humanitarian aid.

France's UN ambassador, Francois Delattre, told reporters the compromise was reached after more than three hours of closed consultations on Sunday and the Security Council would vote on the resolution on Monday.

Russia's UN ambassador, Vitaly Churkin, told reporters before consultations that Moscow could not accept the French draft resolution unless it was changed.

He presented council members with a rival text.

After the consultations, Churkin said a ""good text"" had been formulated.

The US ambassador to the UN, Samantha Power, said the resolution would quickly put more than 100 UN personnel on the ground to monitor evacuations.

""The text contains all the elements for safe, secure, dignified evacuation, for humanitarian access to those who choose to remain in eastern Aleppo"" and for protecting civilians, she said.

She said that following the siege in eastern Aleppo, there have been ""many, many reports of people being pulled off buses and disappeared, whether into conscription or into torture chambers or killed outright.""

Deploying UN monitors would deter ""some of the worst excesses,"" she said.

Russia, which has provided military backing to Assad, has vetoed six Security Council resolutions on Syria since the conflict started in 2011.

China joined Russia in vetoing five resolutions.

The Security Council was expected to vote on the text on Monday, according to diplomats and UN officials.

Earlier, a number of buses meant to evacuate the fighters and their families were sent to eastern Aleppo as part of the deal to evacuate people from the rebel-held sector, in return for the evacuation of people from Al-Fua and Kefraya, two Shia-majority villages in Idlib province.

The Council had been scheduled to vote on Sunday on a French draft, but Russia, an ally of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's government in the civil war, circulated a rival text.

Russia raised concerns about sending in UN officials unprepared to monitor the protection of civilians who remain in eastern Aleppo, which has been under government siege for years.

'A good text'

Samantha Power, the US ambassador to the UN, said the Security Council expected to ""vote unanimously for this text"" at 9am local time (14:00 GMT) on Monday.

Vitaly Churkin, Russia's UN ambassador, said: ""I think we have a good text.""

The UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) said some of the buses that had arrived to Al-Fua and Kefraya came under attack and were burned.

State television broadcast pictures of flames rising from the green buses.

""We understand the buses were empty at the time,"" said Al Jazeera's Imtiaz Tyab, reporting from Gaziantep on the Turkish-Syrian border.

""Really, what we're seeing is some sort of tit-for-tat situation which effectively puts any evacuations on hold.""

Our correspondent was referring to the four people who reportedly were recently killed by Syrian government forces as they attempted to leave eastern Aleppo.

Reports said ambulances and buses were able to enter Foua and Kefraya late on Sunday after being prevented from entering for hours .

The SOHR said the evacuation operation would evacuate about 4,000 people, including patients, orphans and families.

The process ground to a halt on Friday after a disagreement between the rebels and a coalition of forces fighting for Assad's government, who wanted people to be allowed to leave Foua and Kefraya.

Over 15,000 people had gathered in a square in east Aleppo on Sunday for buses to take them to rebel-held areas outside the city.

Many had spent the night sleeping in the streets in freezing temperatures.

""Conditions in eastern Aleppo remain extremely dire,"" said Al Jazeera's Tyab.

""In the evenings, it can go to -5C. They have access to very little food, fuel, water and medical supplies. The situation on the ground remains grim as people wait.""

'Just staying alive'

Speaking to Al Jazeera via Skype, Ismail al-Abdullah, a civilian trapped in east Aleppo, said: ""Two injured people waiting for the Red Crescent died while they were waiting to be evacuated, while they were waiting to be treated ... we told them many times, 'You will be evacuated, wait for the ambulances', but that didn't happen and they died.""

With others, Abdullah tried to visit the evacuation point on Sunday. ""When we saw the number of people, we thought they would be unable to evacuate this number of people, so we turned around,"" he said.

""We are under siege ... we are just surviving now. We are just staying alive.""

Aleppo-based opposition fighters and their family members will be allowed to leave, in return for subsequent batches of people departing Foua and Kefraya, according to Syria's Al-Ikhbariya news channel.

Evacuation operation

Thousands of people were evacuated on Thursday, the first to leave under the ceasefire deal between the government and the rebels, which would end years of fighting for Aleppo and mark a major victory for Assad.

Those who were evacuated on Thursday were taken to rebel-held districts of the countryside west of Aleppo.

Turkey has said Aleppo evacuees could also be housed in a camp to be constructed near the Turkish border to the north.

Eastern Ghouta was once a powerful rebel bastion on the doorstep of Damascus. The area has been partially besieged since 2013, but conditions have deteriorated further in recent weeks under the weight of near-daily Syrian and Russian bombardments, as well as creeping ground offensives.

""People are facing bombing by every kind of weapon of war … spreading fear in the hearts of civilians in the marketplaces, streets and even mosques,"" said Abu Khaled, police chief with the local council in Douma, the largest town in Eastern Ghouta.

He said that bombardments have recently targeted schools, alleging the use of ""internationally sanctioned weapons … and particularly cluster bombs,"" - claims that have also been made by local civil defence units and human rights groups. Over the past week, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights has documented several deadly bombardments by pro-government forces. Some residents fear a looming ground offensive, as in Aleppo.

Analysts say that Damascus is planning to either remove or disarm rebel fighters in Eastern Ghouta, similar to a series of evacuation and truce deals in Daraya, Moadamiyat al-Sham, al-Waer and Khan Eshieh. The government is reportedly fielding talks in Douma and other neighbourhoods, but due to the sheer size of the area and its composition, the outcome remains uncertain.

According to the US-based monitoring group Siege Watch's last quarterly report, approximately 435,000 civilians live inside an ever-shrinking 100 square-kilometres of sprawling urban neighbourhoods, suburbs and farmland, while there are also an estimated 10,000 fighters inside Eastern Ghouta.

""People forget this, but both territorially and in terms of population, it's bigger than east Aleppo. [The rebels'] military arsenal is much bigger and more powerful than in eastern Aleppo as well,"" said analyst Aron Lund, a nonresident fellow at the Carnegie Endowment's Middle East programme. He noted that rebel groups have repeatedly hit the heart of Damascus with shells and mortars and downed Syrian aircraft with anti-aircraft weapons in the past.

The area is besieged, and every now and then, you hear the thunderous voices of warplanes or bombs. You are a close neighbour of death every day - every day. I saw it with my own eyes. Yassin Haj al-Saleh, writer

Although Damascus will likely try to deal with Eastern Ghouta's neighbourhoods one-by-one, Abu Khaled said that local officials and rebel groups would place conditions on any deal.

""We had our revolution together, and we were besieged together, so Douma will not go alone. Any peaceful solution should be for the whole of Eastern Ghouta,"" he said, calling for international mediation in the ongoing truce talks. ""The regime can't be lawyer, judge and executioner all at the same time.""

Should Eastern Ghouta fall, the Syrian rebellion will lose one of its most important symbols. In many respects, the story of Eastern Ghouta is the story of the uprising - from liberation and perceived betrayal to the slow death of the siege.

""Eastern Ghouta showed the liberatory potential of the revolution,"" said leftist writer and thinker Yassin Haj al-Saleh, who moved to Douma in 2013. ""People came from Damascus to help, and there were many local activists also building networks and being active.""

Saleh, who served 16 years as a political prisoner in government jails, arrived via an underground smuggling tunnel in April 2013. He was later joined by his wife, activist Samira al-Khalil, as well as renowned human rights defender and cofounder of the Violations Documentation Centre, Razan Zaitouneh.

In December of that year, Khalil, Zaitouneh and two other activists were abducted by armed men and have not been heard from since.

Saleh recounts memories of conversations in morgues, clinics and formative council meetings.

""The area is besieged, and every now and then, you hear the thunderous voices of warplanes or bombs. You are a close neighbour of death every day - every day. I saw it with my own eyes,"" Saleh said, recounting the moment that two farm workers in al-Mleha were shelled and buried within 30 minutes so that their families need not see their mutilated remains.

It was a kind of routine, and it began to change Eastern Ghouta.

""People felt that they were not understood and that they were not respected, that their sufferings were not taken into consideration by the world at large,"" Saleh said. ""And they were right about this feeling of being deserted, neglected, disrespected, dismissed.""

On August 21, 2013, government forces bombarded Eastern Ghouta with sarin gas, killing more than 1,500 men, women and children. Despite talk of a red line, the international community settled with a chemical weapons disarmament deal brokered between the United States and Russia. The world looked on, and anti-Assad Syrians felt betrayed.

""[This feeling] pushed people even towards more religion and more nihilism. And this process ... benefited a lot of those Salafist groups in Douma,"" Saleh said, noting this ""became the ideological basis for armed struggle against the regime"".

By late 2013, much of Eastern Ghouta was under the control of Jaish al-Islam, a homegrown Salafist faction that, at its height, was engaged in everything from arms production to lucrative tunnel smuggling.

IN PICTURES: Syria Civil War - Inside the bomb shelter

But power led to excesses, Saleh noted, and Jaish al-Islam has been significantly weakened since the death of its leader Zahran Alloush last December and subsequent factional infighting. Damascus seized its opportunity and has been slowly closing in on Eastern Ghouta ever since.

""The story of the Ghouta is that you had a situation unlike all the rest of Syria, really,"" Lund said. ""You had this strong faction that was so big and so strong that everyone had to recognise that they were the alpha faction.""

The situation led to the emergence of united forms of local government, along with law and order. But that may soon be gone.

""[Damascus will continue pushing] until it gets the deal it wants - and it will want the rebels out or disarmed,"" Lund added. ""Looking at the situation now, it doesn't look like there's any other way out."""

The rebel official told Al Jazeera on Saturday that the deal would allow for the complete evacuation of the embattled enclaves still held by rebel groups.

Speaking to the Reuters news agency, a Syrian government source confirmed the agreement.

Saturday's announcement came after previous agreements brokered by Turkey and Russia fell apart, with the Syrian government and opposition groups exchanging blame.

In addition to eastern Aleppo, the deal will allow for the transfer of civilians from the rebel-besieged towns of Kafraya and Fua, as well as the government-blockaded towns of Madaya and Zabadani.

A day earlier, Syrian state media said more than 8,000 people had been evacuated from the besieged territory when the agreement was suspended.

The deal would have allowed for the remaining population of rebel-held neighbourhoods to be transferred through government-controlled territory to the city of Idlib, where Jabhat Fateh al-Sham (formerly known as the al-Nusra Front, which was linked to al-Qaeda) and rebel groups control most of the territory.

IN PHOTOS: Ghosts of Aleppo

The Syrian government accused rebel groups of breaching the terms of the agreement, saying they tried to smuggle out fighters and heavy weapons.

The rebels were also accused of failing to honour a condition that stipulated they should allow for the evacuation of thousands of civilians from Kafraya and Al-Fua, both Shia Muslim towns besieged by rebel groups in the Idlib province.

Journalist Zouhir Al Shimale was among about a thousand civilians detained by pro-government militias on Friday night when their convoy was stopped as the ceasefire collapsed.

Witnesses told Al Jazeera that government forces had killed at least four people who were part of the convoy.

Tens of thousands of people were still trapped inside opposition-controlled areas and were too scared to leave their besieged districts, Al Jazeera's Amro Halabi reported from eastern Aleppo.

""Now, the people are afraid and they are running away from the meeting point where they were supposed to gather in order to take the buses out of the besieged east Aleppo districts, they are in a state of horror and shock,"" he said.

Aleppo, Syria's second largest city and once a key cultural and economic hub, has been divided between government forces and rebels since 2012.

The evacuation agreements came a month after the Syrian government and allied militias launched a military offensive to retake the entire city. Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has hailed the operation as a victory.

The Syrian conflict started as a largely unarmed uprising against Assad's rule in March 2011. It has since morphed into a full-scale civil war that has left hundreds of thousands dead and more than half of the country's prewar population displaced inside and outside of Syria."

More than 3,000 people were taken out of east Aleppo on Thursday, but a convoy of about 800 people was turned back the next day and the evacuation suspended. Four evacuaees were also killed, witnesses told Al Jazeera, and people were beaten up and robbed of cash before being sent back.

A new ceasefire deal to evacuate tens of thousands of Syrian opposition fighters and civilians was reached, according to a rebel group official.

However, trapped Syrians waited desperately on Saturday for evacuations to resume and the Red Cross pleaded for a deal to ""save thousands of lives"".

Munir al-Sayal, head of the political wing of the Ahrar al-Sham rebel group involved in negotiations over the deal, said Iran was insisting people be allowed to leave two rebel-besieged Shia villages in northwest Syria - al-Foua and Kefraya - before letting the Aleppo evacuation happen.

He said Russia was failing to restrain its ally.

""Iran and its sectarian proxies are using the humanitarian situation of our people in besieged Aleppo and preventing civilians from leaving until the evacuation of their groups in al-Foua and Kefraya,"" Sayal told Reuters news agency in a telephone interview.

OPINION: Aleppo - The guilt, the resentment, the indifference

Sayal said Iranian-backed fighters, led by Lebanon's Hezbollah and other Iraqi Shia groups, were behind the detention of hundreds of people trying to leave on Friday.

""These sectarian militias are responsible, but we warn them the safety of our people in Aleppo is the priority and all options are open towards achieving that goal,"" said Sayal.

He said Moscow's assertion that most civilians had already been evacuated from Aleppo showed Russia was trying to renege on its responsibilities under the deal.

""Russia has failed to restrain the sectarian Shia militias in Aleppo to complete the deal and Moscow should abide by its commitments. There are still civilians in Aleppo who need to be evacuated in harsh weather conditions and Russian statements that besieged Aleppo is empty is absolving itself from following up on the agreement.""

Families spent the night in freezing temperatures in al-Amiriyah district, the departure point for evacuations before they were halted on Friday.

""There's no more food or drinking water, and the situation is getting worse by the day,"" Abu Omar, who waited in the cold for nine hours on Friday, told the AFP news agency. He returned the next day only to be told the buses were not coming.

UN envoy Staffan de Mistura estimated, as of Thursday, about 40,000 civilians and perhaps as many as 5,000 opposition fighters remained in Aleppo's rebel enclave.

In New York, the UN Security Council could vote as early as this weekend on a French-drafted proposal to allow international observers in Aleppo and ensure urgent aid deliveries.

On Friday, US President Barack Obama called for impartial observers to monitor efforts to evacuate civilians, and warned Syrian President Bashar al-Assad would not be able to ""slaughter his way to legitimacy"".

Aleppo, Syria's second-largest city and once a key cultural and economic hub, has been divided between government forces and rebels since 2012.

""Shamelessly, the British have recently called ... Iran a threat to the region, but everyone knows that ... it is the British who have always been the source of threats, corruption and misery,"" state news agency IRNA quoted Khamenei on Saturday as telling participants at an Islamic unity conference in Tehran.

Khamenei called ""policies and the actions of the British in the past two centuries a source of evil and misery for the peoples of the region"", IRNA added.

May called on Gulf Arab heads of state at a summit last week to work with London ""to push back against Iran's aggressive regional actions, whether in Lebanon, Iraq, Yemen, Syria or in the Gulf itself"".

""So I want to assure you that I am clear-eyed about the threat that Iran poses to the Gulf and the wider Middle East,"" she told the summit in Bahrain on December 7.

What will Trump do with the Iran nuclear deal?

Khamenei accused the United States and Britain of provoking conflicts among the main Sunni and Shia branches of Islam. ""The old British policy of 'divide and conquer' is seriously on the agenda of Islam's enemies.""

Iranian media reported on Saturday the foreign ministry had summoned a top British diplomat in Tehran to protest against British criticism of its actions in Syria.

The move came after British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said on Thursday he had summoned the ambassadors of Russia and Iran to convey his ""profound disquiet"" over events in the besieged Syrian city of Aleppo.

Britain and Iran exchanged ambassadors in September more than a year after Britain reopened its Tehran embassy, which was closed for nearly four years after it was stormed by protesters.

Iran and most Gulf states are on opposite sides in Middle East conflicts, with Iran an ally of President Bashar al-Assad in Syria's war and of the armed Houthi movement fighting a Saudi-led military coalition in Yemen."

Elsewhere in Paris, and in London, Amsterdam, Oslo and Copenhagen, people demonstrated against the slaughter. Turks rallied outside Russian and Iranian embassies and consulates in Istanbul, Ankara and Erzurum. The people of Sarajevo, who have their own experience of genocide, staged a big protest.

The protests are nothing like as large as they were when the United States bombed Iraq, but they are welcome nonetheless. If this level of support had been apparent over the last six years, it would have made a real difference.

Perhaps it is making a difference even now. Public sympathy for the victims may have pressured Vladimir Putin to allow those in the surviving liberated sliver of Aleppo to evacuate, rather than face annihilation.

At the time of writing, the fate of the deal is in doubt, subject to the whims of the militias on the ground. If it works out and the tens of thousands currently trapped are allowed to leave - the best possible outcome - then we will be witnesses to an internationally brokered forced population transfer.

This is both a war crime and a crime against humanity, and a terrible image of the precarious state of the global system. The weight of this event, and its future ramifications, deserve more than just a few demonstrations.

The 'war on terrorism' excuse

The abandonment of Aleppo is a microcosm of the more general abandonment of Syria's democratic revolution. It exposes the failures of the Arab and Muslim worlds, of the West, and of humanity as a whole.

Many Syrians expected the global left would be first to support their cause, but most leftist commentators and publications retreated into conspiracy theories, Islamophobia, and inaccurate geopolitical analysis, and swallowed gobbets of Assadist propaganda whole. Soon, they were repeating the ""war on terror"" tropes of the right.

Victory for Assad is also a victory for ISIL.

The Obama administration provided a little rhetorical support and sometimes allowed its allies to send weapons to the Free Army. Crucially, however, Obama vetoed supply of the anti-aircraft weapons the Free Army, so desperately needed to counter Assad's scorched-earth campaign. In August 2013, when Assad killed 1,500 people with sarin gas in the Damascus suburbs, Obama's chemical ""red line"" vanished, and the US more or less publicly handed Syria over to Russia and Iran.

Keeping to the ""war on terror"" framework, the US bombs the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) and others in Syria, hitting the symptoms rather than the cause of the crisis. Europe, meanwhile, declares a crisis over the refugees arriving on its shores. So long as Assad remains in power, most of these refugees will not return home.

As for the Arab states, a combination of sectarianism, Iranian domination, and counter-revolutionary fervour led several to collude in Assad's war. Others supported elements of the opposition, but in a disorganised and tepid manner.

ISIL and Assad winning

The tragedy has also exposed the weaknesses of Syrian society, vulnerabilities which Assad so cleverly manipulated. By organising massacres (particularly in 2012, on the plain between Homs and Hama), by releasing Salafist-Jihadists from prison, even as he tortured and killed thousands of democratic activists, then by inviting in foreign Shia militias, Assad engineered a sectarian breakdown.

Too many Syrians fell too easily into his trap. When, for instance, Zahran Alloush - founder of Jaish al-Islam and himself a beneficiary of Assad's prison amnesty - called for Damascus to be ""cleansed of Shia influence"", he played right into Assad's hands.

OPINION: And who are we to say the Syrian revolution is dead?

Yet, the revolution exposed strengths which Syrians didn't know they possessed. Communities held elections and organised themselves in local councils. They set up women's centres, independent trades unions and free radio and TV stations. Aleppo was by far the largest centre of such civil society initiatives.

It's not surprising when conservative states allow a revolution to drown. It's more shocking that they stand idle as Arab sovereignty collapses.

Assad lost the war he provoked. By September 2015, when the Russian bombing started, his depleted army held less than a fifth of the country.

He calculated correctly, however, that powerful friends would come to his aid. When Russia arrived it employed the usual excuse - the ""war on terror"", in this case on ISIL, also known as ISIS - but less than 20 percent of its bombs fell anywhere near ISIL. Instead, its planes focused relentlessly on eviscerating the Free Syrian Army, as well as the civilian infrastructure in liberated areas. They burned schools, hospitals and markets. They dropped cluster munitions, incendiary bombs and bunker busters - banned in civilian areas - on residential blocks. These, too, are war crimes.

The majority of the ground forces surrounding Aleppo are not Syrian. Most are Shia jihadists from Lebanon, Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan, funded and trained by Iran. As well as these proxies, Iran has its own Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) in theatre, often commanding Syrians. In Iraq too, the sectarian Popular Mobilisation Units are under IRGC command. In Lebanon, the Iranian-inspired and funded Hezbollah dominates.

Iranian expansionism accompanies the sectarian/political cleansing of areas of Homs and Damascus, as well as Aleppo, creating demographic changes which won't be reversed by another consignment of missiles.

Victory for Assad is also a victory for ISIL. As Aleppo was being subjugated, ISIL retook Palmyra, capturing important weapons stocks. At the same time, an increasing number of Syrians facing sectarian aggression - though still a minority - are buying into the nihilist ISIL narrative.

None of this stays in Syria. So how do the Arabs respond? Hamas organised a protest in Gaza, Kuwaitis demonstrated outside the Russian embassy, and Qatar cancelled its national day celebrations. It's not nearly enough.

With good reason, the revolutionary thinker Yassin al-Haj Saleh wrote of the ""Palestinisation"" of the Syrian people. Sixty-eight years after failing to defend Palestine, Arab states have proved incapable of defending Syria from Russian, Iranian and ISIL occupation. They have, however, taught a repeat lesson to their subjects - that sovereignty is meaningless without democratic control. This imperative, which galvanised the 2011 revolutions, is today more relevant than ever.

Two men, who were part of the group, also said the entire convoy was briefly detained and told Al Jazeera's Amro Halabi, reporting from east Aleppo, that security forces opened fire on evacuees before forcing them to return to the war-torn city.

""They forced us out of the vehicles, forced us to lay flat on the ground, stripped us of our clothes and then we heard gunfire,"" one of the men said.

Following the incident, the Syrian government suspended the evacuation that began on Thursday as part of a ceasefire deal to move civilians to rebel-held Idlib province.

The government also accused rebels of trying to smuggle out prisoners and heavy weapons.

More than 40 buses and ambulances had evacuated almost 3,000 people from east Aleppo to neighbouring Idlib province on Thursday. At the time of the deal's suspension, the government-run SANA news agency reported that more than 8,000 residents of eastern Aleppo, among them fighters, had been evacuated.

Tens of thousands of people were still trapped inside east Aleppo and were too scared to leave their besieged districts, Al Jazeera's Halabi said.

""Now the people are afraid and they are running away from the meeting point where they were supposed to gather in order to take the buses out of the besieged east Aleppo districts, they are in a state of horror and shock,"" he said.

Zouhir al Shimale, an independent journalist in east Aleppo, was part of the convoy that was held up. He told Al Jazeera that in addition to being beaten, the civilians were also robbed of cash before being sent back.

""They took us after we reached regime areas, handcuffed us, killed four, and told us its payback. Then we came back,"" he said on Twitter.

In another tweet, he said militias robbed evacuees ""of all their money"" before blocking them.

Al Jazeera's Charles Stratford, reporting from the city of Antakya in neighbouring Turkey, said that he received reports that Iranian militiamen were the ones who blocked the convoy.

""They blocked this convoy of around 20 vehicles from leaving east Aleppo. Another witness said those militias opened fire, took some men off the buses and stripped search them.""

He also described the situation in east Aleppo as ""desperate"", before adding ""a lot of the residents were scared to come out of their houses, they are very scared about moving independently into government-controlled areas"".

Russia, which backs the Syrian government, denied the convoy was stopped.

The evacuation began a month to the day after Syrian government forces launched a major offensive to retake all of Aleppo, and will hand the Syrian President Bashar al-Assad his biggest victory in more than five years of civil war.

On Friday, US President Barack Obama warned Assad that he would not be able to ""slaughter his way to legitimacy"" and also put responsibility on the Syrian regime's Iranian and Russian backers for the civilian deaths in Aleppo.

""The world, as we speak, is united in horror at the savage assault by the Syrian regime and its Russian and Iranian regime on the city of Aleppo,"" said Obama. ""This blood and these atrocities are on their hands.""

Outgoing UN chief Ban Ki-moon called Aleppo a ""synonym for hell"", before adding that he told the Security Council ""we have collectively failed the people of Syria"".

Aleppo, Syria's second largest city and once a key cultural and economic hub, has been divided between government forces and rebels since 2012.

In a video message to Syrians, Assad said the ""liberation"" of Aleppo was ""history in the making"".

But Pawel Krzysiek, communications chief of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), said there was ""fear, desperation and anxiety"" on the streets.

""People are waiting with children and elders,"" said Krzysiek from Aleppo.

""It's really cold here. They are on the streets burning plastic to keep warm. I can see hundreds, if not thousands, waiting to be evacuated."""

Speaking to Reuters news agency on Friday, a Syrian government official overseeing the operation said it was suspended due to ""obstructions"".

At the time of the deal's suspension, the government-run SANA news agency reported that more than 8,000 residents of eastern Aleppo, among them fighters, had been evacuated.

State TV reported that rebel groups were attempting to smuggle prisoners and heavy weapons out with them, violating the evacuation deal.

The Turkish state news agency, meanwhile, said pro-government forces first attacked the convoy. Speaking to Reuters, a rebel commander confirmed the claim.

Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said talks between the Syrian government and opposition forces would take place soon in Kazakhstan, adding that Turkey would not speak directly to Syrian government officials.

Russian President Vladimir Putin said earlier he was working closely with Turkey to try and start a new series of Syrian peace talks aimed at securing a nationwide ceasefire.

As part of an agreement between Turkey and Russia, tens of thousands of rebels and civilians were supposed to be evacuated from eastern Aleppo to rebel-held Idlib, allowing the Syrian government to take full control of the city after years of fighting.

The operation began on Thursday and was expected to take several days.

READ MORE: Syria's Civil War Explained

The agreement also allowed for the evacuation of thousands of civilians from Kefraya and Fua, two Shia-majority towns besieged by rebel forces.

Rebels allegedly shelled the towns on Friday morning around the same time the evacuation from eastern Aleppo was halted.

Al Jazeera's Imtiaz Tyab, reporting from Gaziantep on the Turkish side of the Turkey-Syria border, said there were conflicting reports of who started the fighting.

""According to several sources, an Iranian-backed militia blocked a road that the evacuees would be using to reach the Aleppo countryside. It then started firing,"" he said.

""According to the reports, they were protesting against this evacuation deal, which would see the villages of Fua and Kefraya evacuated in a similar way east Aleppo was.""

A Turkish official told Turkish news agency Anadolou that Syrian government forces had arrested at least 800 people before the suspension of the agreement.

Meanwhile, a suicide attack in a southeastern neighbourhood of Syria's capital Damascus has killed three people and wounded at least four others.

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a Britain-based monitor, said the blast took place in the Midan district of Damascus.

Rebel groups have fired rockets and mortar rounds into the capital but explosions inside the city itself are rare.

According to pro-government daily Al-Watan, the blast left ""the female suicide bomber dead and wounded three police officers from the station"".

'Thousands still waiting'

Zouhir Al Shimale, a journalist in eastern Aleppo, reported that the evacuation had been moving at a snail's pace.

""People were outside in the street overnight,"" he told Al Jazeera on Friday morning, adding that the temperature had dipped below zero degrees Celsius in the city. ""Thousands are still waiting out here.""

Kerry said what had already happened in the city was ""unconscionable"" but warned over the fate of ""tens of thousands of lives that are now concentrated into a very small area of Aleppo"".

""And the last thing anybody wants to see ... is that that small area turns into another Srebrenica,"" he said, referring to the 1995 Bosnian war massacre.

UN envoy Staffan de Mistura said on Thursday that around 50,000 people were still trapped, including 40,000 civilians.

The evacuations were announced on Thursday, after an initial plan for civilians and fighters to leave rebel-held parts of the city collapsed the previous day amid renewed clashes.

READ MORE: After Aleppo, what happens to Syria's besieged towns?

They began with a convoy of ambulances and buses crossing into a government-held district in southern Aleppo in the afternoon.

A first evacuation attempt on Wednesday fell apart, with artillery exchanges and resumed air strikes rocking the city until the early hours of Thursday.

But the agreement, brokered by Assad's ally Russia and opposition supporter Turkey, was revived following fresh talks.

'Mass depopulation'

The defence ministry in Moscow said Syrian authorities had guaranteed the safety of the rebels leaving the city.

The head of the UN-backed humanitarian task force for Syria, Jan Egeland, said in Geneva that most of those evacuated from Aleppo would head to opposition stronghold Idlib, in Syria's northwest.

READ MORE: Syria's civil war explained

De Mistura however warned that ""Idlib will become the next Aleppo"" if a ceasefire and political agreement for Syria is not found.

AlHakam Shaar, a research fellow at the Budapest-based Aleppo Project, an initiative that tracks the destruction in the historic city, described the deal as the final phase of a ""mass depopulation"".

""Any sustainable peace agreement in Syria will have to guarantee free return for the displaced, females and males, along with their civil society formations,"" he told Al Jazeera.

""A return to centralised, authoritarian governance under the Syrian government is likely to again sideline the population that was very marginalised before 2011."""

A slow-moving convoy of around two dozen vehicles snaked out of Al-Amiriyah district and crossed into government-held Ramussa en route to rebel-held territory in the west of Aleppo province.

Later in the day, two more convoys comprising over 15 buses left for the countryside to the west, Syrian state television reported.

The evacuation got off to a shaky start. Ibrahim Abu Allaith of the Syrian Civil Defence told Al Jazeera that militias loyal to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad reportedly killed at least one person and injured four more while firing on the first convoy of injured evacuees.

AFP news agency reported that the first batch of convoy was led by vehicles from the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and the Syrian Arab Red Crescent, followed by ambulances and then green government buses.

ICRC spokeswoman Ingy Sedky said the first convoy included 13 ambulances and 20 buses carrying civilians. The World Health Organization (WHO) reported a total of 21 buses and 19 ambulanes had left east Aleppo.

""They have crossed the front line and are on their way to rural parts of western Aleppo,"" Sedky told AFP.

The evacuation on Thursday was part of a ceasefire expected to last three days and result in the transfer of thousands of civilians and fighters from the embattled territory.

READ MORE: Battle for Aleppo - 'The sound of bullets doesn't stop'

Zouhir Al Shimale, an independent journalist in east Aleppo, said the evacuation was still under way despite the attacks on an ambulance.

""There hasn't been fighting since the morning,"" he told Al Jazeera, explaining that ""hundreds of families"" have gathered at the departure point for the buses.

""Civilians are given the choice to stay or leave. If they stay, they'll be under regime control. Most of the people want to go because they are afraid of potential massacres by the regime,"" Shimale added.

""In recent days, people are desperate to get to somewhere where we have the supplies - food, medicine, fuel - like we used to have in the days before the siege. Even if they are in refugee camps, but people still want to leave the besieged area.""

As part of the agreement, the Russian defence ministry said that it was preparing for the transfer of rebel fighters by buses and ambulances to Idlib city, located around 65 kilometres from Aleppo.

Deadly fighting broke out on Wednesday after a similar truce deal collapsed.

Under the initial plan, thousands of civilians and rebel fighters were due to evacuate the east of Syria's second city, scene of some of the worst violence in more than five years of war across the country.

The delay came on Wednesday morning when pro-government Shia militias demanded that civilians in Kafraya and al-Fua - two towns besieged by armed opposition groups - be evacuated, as well.

READ MORE: How much longer can east Aleppo hold out?

Thursday's agreement allowed for the evacuation of wounded civilians from Kafraya and Fua, and ambulances were reportedly en route to the two towns by noon local time (10:00 GMT).

Turkey said it would meet with Russia and Iran in Moscow on December 27 to discuss a political solution to the conflict in Syria.

Syria's army has pressed a month-long assault that has seen it take more than 90 percent of the former rebel stronghold in east Aleppo.

Turkey has said those leaving would be taken to Idlib province, which is controlled by a powerful rebel alliance that includes Jabhat Fateh al-Sham.The UN said on Tuesday that it had credible reports of at least 82 civilians, including 11 women and 13 children, being executed in recent days.

And the UN's Commission of Inquiry for Syria said it had received reports opposition fighters were blocking civilians from fleeing Aleppo and using them as human shields.

Aleppo, a cultural and economic hub second only to Damascus in importance, had been split between a rebel-controlled east and government-held west since 2012.

It was unclear how many civilians remained in rebel territory, after an estimated 130,000 fled to other parts of Aleppo during the government advance since mid-November.

Syria's conflict has evolved from largely unarmed protests against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad into a full-scale civil war that has killed hundreds of thousands and displaced more than half of the country's prewar population.

READ MORE: What went wrong in Syria's east Aleppo?

Marwan Kabalan, a Syria analyst and associate political analyst at the Doha Institute, said he expects the Syrian government to focus its attacks on the Damascus suburbs after the fall of Aleppo.

""I think the regime will turn next to targeting the Damascus suburbs,"" he told Al Jazeera. ""Idlib is becoming a point of exile for fighters ... I think it will remain like this till the very end [of the conflict].""

Throughout four years of fighting, Aleppo has seen intense battles that left much of the city in ruins.

AlHakam Shaar, a research fellow at the Budapest-based Aleppo Project , an initiative that tracks the destruction in the historic city, explained that more than 20 percent of Aleppo's buildings were fully destroyed and another 40 percent partially damaged as far back as early 2014.

""The percentages are far higher now. However, there is no way to accurately measure the extent of destruction without a full on the ground survey,"" he told Al Jazeera.

""There will also be a need for planning the rehabilitation of whole systems of infrastructure, from roads to water networks.""

""There are principles that apply to our business,"" he concluded.

The 19th-century German general and strategist who wrote ""war is the continuation of politics by other means,"" historically had a deep influence in US policy-making circles. Yet, in recent years when it comes to Syria and other conflicts, an addiction to diplomacy has led to failure. The US has not achieved its goals, with disastrous consequences.

Period of anti-strategy

On December 5, the US was again frustrated at the United Nations Security Council as Russia and China vetoed a resolution calling for a seven-day ceasefire in Aleppo. Russia's refusal was a ""made-up alibi"" said Michele Sison, the US deputy envoy to the UN, ""we will not let Russia string along the Security Council"". An empty threat. The French noted that Russia was pushing for its Syrian ally to take Aleppo ""regardless of the human cost"". Correct.

The reality of US policy in the last years of the Obama administration is that it has elevated diplomacy to an unrealistic position such that diplomacy is conducted for diplomacy's sake alone, untethered from other options.

It has become a series of carrots, without the proverbial stick. The administration sees that as garnering success in the Iran nuclear deal in 2015 and smoothing relations with Cuba after 50 years.

But on Syria particularly, and on other issues such as pressuring Israel or dealing with Myanmar's treatment of the Rohingya, the US has been frustrated because its opponents see through the diplomatic-only approach. The US has entered a period of anti-strategy, in which it lays its cards on the table first and then seeks to play poker.

It should have been a foregone conclusion that attempts at a ceasefire in Syria would go nowhere.

US Secretary of State John Kerry has articulated genuine concern for the Syrian people. ""The suffering that we have witnessed in Syria over the course of more than five years now is really beyond inhumane,"" he said in Geneva on September 9.

He has met numerous times with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, but his conclusion that ""we have worked together to try to build a consensus on the broad steps and then to develop specific ideas"", is misguided.

The bifurcation of diplomacy from consequences means one group of actors play on two playing fields, war and diplomacy, and their opponents only confront them on the diplomatic field.

Knowing well that the Syrian regime and its allies had broken the other ceasefires and used them to their advantage, he refused to acknowledge that the whole nature of the endless negotiations was working in Russia's favour.

Every month that the negotiations dragged on, the rebels became weaker and millions of refugees became more desperate. ""The US and Russia have agreed on steps which we will take, providing there is a sustained period of reduced violence,"" Kerry claimed. Yet, the Syrian regime does not reduce violence, and five years have proved that.

Two months after these statements a sustained offensive drove the rebels from much of Aleppo. The negotiations since 2013 have only served to cement Bashar al-Assad in power, not erode his legitimacy. If there had never been US-led diplomacy in the first place, the regime would probably still be where it is today.

War as extension of diplomacy

For much of human history, war and diplomacy were part of the same enterprise. When the Persian King Darius sent his envoys to the Greek city-states in 491BC to demand they recognise his suzerainty, it was understood refusal would be met with force of arms.

Henry V of England attacked France in 1415 after supposedly receiving a mocking gift of tennis balls rather than recognition of his claims from the French king.

OPINION: John Kerry and Sergey Lavrov - Fatal attraction I

In modern times, diplomacy has been stylised and romanticised as somehow independent from its Clausewitzian relation to force of arms.

History forgets the bloodletting that underpinned the Congress of Vienna and made fame of Lord Castlereagh and Klemens von Metternich.

A decade after the World War I, the US Secretary of State Frank B Kellogg and French Foreign Minister Aristide Briand put forth a pact to end the use of war as a policy. The world shall ""refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force,"" the pact predicted, which later was incorporated into the charter of the United Nations.

Within three years Japan had invaded Manchuria and by 1935 Benito Mussolini's Italy was using mustard gas - prohibited by the Geneva Protocol in 1925 - to massacre Ethiopians.

Fearing confrontation

There is a direct parallel with countries like the US that broadcast their intention to only use diplomacy. When Adolf Hitler set his sights on aggressive expansion in 1933, he did so with knowledge that the Oxford Union, the elite of British society, had voted in February 1933 that under ""no circumstances"" would they ""fight for king and country"". If your adversaries know that a society fears confrontation and relies only on blandishments and diplomacy, the diplomacy is sure to fail.

The US has faced this problem over the past half-decade. Obama came to office with a mandate to draw down US involvement abroad. He reduced the US presence in Iraq and Afghanistan.

But the US led military intervention in Libya in 2011 and built an anti-ISIL coalition of more than 30 countries in 2014. From the moment the US refused action on Syria in 2013 over chemical weapons, Assad and his allies in Russia, Iran and Hezbollah understood that the US would pursue a diplomacy-only track on Damascus.

John Kerry also warned in 2013 that Israel's policies risked scuppering a two-state solution. Yet, at the Saban Forum on December 4, he claimed that he had talked to Benjamin Netanyahu 375 times, ""more than 130 hours"" and travelled to Israel 40 times. What was there to show for all that? Nothing. No progress on Palestinian statehood, no progress on reversing Israeli policies that the US disagrees with, such as construction of settlements.

OPINION: Syria war exposes the failure of power games

In foreign policy, countries that know there will be no repercussions carry on with their policies. Whether it is China building bases in the South China Sea, Myanmar's treatment of Muslim minorities, or Russian actions in Ukraine and the Baltic, the addiction to diplomacy in the West and elsewhere threatens to turn the world into a Hobbesian ""state of nature"".

In that world, the bifurcation of diplomacy from consequences means one group of actors play on two playing fields, war and diplomacy, and their opponents only confront them on the diplomatic field.

Diplomacy for diplomacy's sake doesn't achieve anything in that conflict. Those who play by Clausewitz's rules will achieve their goals. Those who say ""only diplomacy"" surrender to regimes that cause great human suffering, millions of refugees, extremism and long-term instability.

""There is artillery [being fired] now ... as I speak,"" Zouhir Al Shimale, a journalist in east Aleppo, told Al Jazeera in a WhatsApp message on Wednesday.

""There aren't any clashes,"" he said, explaining rebel groups were not fighting at the moment. ""There are injuries, but we don't know how many. We can't go outside because the shelling is indiscriminate.""

The UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights also said shelling could be heard, but its origin was not clear. Speaking to Reuters news agency, rebel commanders said government forces had renewed shelling and violated a ceasefire reached a day earlier.

Medical sources told Al Jazeera cluster munitions were used in al-Zubdiyeh neighbourhood and elsewhere in the remaining rebel-held areas.

The Russian defence ministry confirmed government forces resumed attacks, claiming rebel groups broke the ceasefire in early Wednesday, according to Russia's Interfax news agency.

Aleppo, once Syria's bustling commercial hub, had been largely divided between a government-held west and a rebel-controlled east since 2012. But government forces are now in control of almost the entire city after weeks of intense fighting and relentless air raids.

On Tuesday night, it was announced a ceasefire between the Syrian government and rebel groups would allow for the evacuation of tens of thousands of residents from the last pockets of rebel-held eastern Aleppo to the Idlib area or to Turkey.

The deal was brokered by Turkey and Russia.

READ MORE: Battle for Aleppo - 'The sound of bullets doesn't stop'

The arrangement was delayed on Wednesday morning, though, with rebel groups claiming a government-aligned Shia militia had turned back evacuees and demanded rebel-imposed sieges of the Shia majority towns of Kafraya and Fua were first lifted.

""Iran rejected the deal and hasn't allowed the city to be evacuated. It has also laid down some conditions of its own,"" Abdul-Mumin Zeineddin, a coordinator for the armed opposition in Aleppo, told Anadolu news agency.

""We will fight on until victory or death,"" he added.

'Massacred in cold blood'

Explaining that civilians were scared the evacuation could be delayed further, Shimale said: ""No one knows what the regime will do.""

""People here are shocked [by the delay],"" Shimale said. ""We didn't sleep last night waiting to leave.""

Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said he expected the last of the ""rebel resistance"" to end within two to three days.

In what appeared to be a separate development from the planned evacuation, the Russian defence ministry said 6,000 civilians and 366 fighters had left rebel-held districts of Aleppo over the past 24 hours.

Fears have been growing for thousands of trapped civilians as rebels make a desperate last stand in their remaining pocket of territory.

Late on Tuesday, Turkey's Deputy Prime Minister Mehmet Simsek announced his government was planning to set up a new tent city to host ""80,000 people fleeing eastern Aleppo"". He did not specify whether the facility would be in Turkey or Syria.

The UN said on Tuesday it received reports about pro-government forces executing scores of civilians in Aleppo, including women and children.

Eighty-two people were reportedly killed when Syrian forces took over rebel-held areas, it said.

Marwan Kabalan, a Syria analyst and associate political analyst at the Doha Institute, said the ceasefire breach may signal growing differences between Russia and Iran.

""The Russians seem to be bowing to international pressure in order to make the truce hold,"" he told Al Jazeera.

""It's clear the Iranians have a different opinion here ... I think they believe that they are winning and must finish off the opposition, rather than allow them to leave the city alive.

A military media unit run by the Syrian government's ally Hezbollah said on Wednesday talks were still taking place over a deal to evacuate fighters from Aleppo, and if government demands were not met, the deal would be off.

Syria's conflict started as a largely unarmed uprising against President Assad in March 2011. It has since morphed into a full-scale civil war that has killed hundreds of thousands and left more than half the country's prewar population displaced.

Efforts to negotiate a lasting resolution between the Syrian government and rebel groups have collapsed several times.

The friendship between the former KGB spy and the Texan oilman - they're both 64 now – dates back to the late 1990s when Tillerson established the biggest presence of a US oil company in Russia, and Putin was a fledgling politician who had just been appointed prime minister in ailing president Boris Yeltsin's government.

In 2013, Putin handed Tillerson a pentacle-shaped Friendship Medal, one of Russia's highest award for foreigners, for ""special merits in development of bilateral ties with Russia"".

Donald Trump names Rex Tillerson as secretary of state

A year earlier, Tillerson presided over a multibillion dollar deal that was designed to help Moscow tap into the immense oil Bonanza in the Arctic - but fell through because of Western sanctions imposed after Crimea's 2014 annexation. Tillerson lambasted the sanctions that cost his company billions of dollars in lost profit.

And now, when Tillerson is a fledgling diplomat and Putin is a seasoned, iron-fisted politician, Kremlin critics wonder whether these amicable ties will mark a U-turn in Washington's dealings with Moscow.

""This appointment is very beneficial for Putin,"" Vladimir Milov, Russia's former deputy energy minister now in opposition to the Kremlin, told Al Jazeera.

Tillerson will create ""an environment that is much more comfortable for Putin that the previous architecture of transatlantic cooperation, a certain unified West with its own certain values"", he said.

Russia's annexation of Crimea, support for separatists in eastern Ukraine, and the pro-Damascus operation in Syria has brought ties with the West back to Cold-War lows.

But the jingoistic, neo-conservative, and pragmatic course chosen by president-elect Donald Trump starkly contradicts years of Washington's policies towards containing Russia - and strangely fits the Kremlin's own political agenda.

No more lectures on democracy?

For most of his rule, Putin wanted the West to treat Moscow as an equal and detested reprimands for his crackdown on opposition figures, corruption, and concentration of key industries around state-run corporations.

Analysts insist Trump's approach will be much more businesslike.

""Russia's leadership proclaimed pragmatism as the basis of its foreign policy a long time ago. If the US will share the same foreign policy principle, I don't think there will be any problems,"" Alexey Mukhin, head of the Moscow-based Centre for Political Information think-tank, told Al Jazeera.

Pro-Kremlin pundits are already ecstatic about the appointment.

""This is a positive development so unexpected that we still don't believe it's happening,"" Kremlin adviser and political analyst Sergei Markov told Al Jazeera.

Profiting on Russia

In 1998-1999, Tillerson served as vice president of Exxon (before the company's merger with Mobil) in charge of operations in the Caspian Sea and on Sakhalin, Russia's largest Pacific island north of Japan.

Dealings with Russian authorities weren't always easy. In April 2015, the company sued Russia at the Stockholm arbitrage court claiming it overpaid profit tax on the Sakhalin project.

But Tillerson soon found himself among Moscow's most trusted Big Oil executives.

In September 2005, Putin met Tillerson - ExxonMobil's president at the time - as well as with the company's then-chief executive Lee Raymond, and top managers of Conoco-Phillips and Shevron-Texaco.

Months earlier, oil tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovskywas sentenced to nine years in jail for alleged fraud in what was widely seen as the Kremlin's revenge for his financial support of the opposition. International investors were worried about the imprisonment, and the meeting was an attempt to reassure them that Moscow was still a reliable partner.

Most of Khodorkovsky's oil company, Yukos, soon became the bulk of state-run Rosneft, ExxonMobil's main Russian partner and its nation's largest oil company. Igor Sechin, a former Portuguese translator and Putin's key ally often described as the second-most powerful man in Russia, heads Rosneft now.

He is also a good friend of Tillerson, according to Russian and western media reports.

Arctic oil dream

In 2011, ExxonMobil outmaneuvered oil giant BP to help Russia develop the world's largest treasure chest of untapped hydrocarbons.

The Arctic Circle holds some 90 billion barrels of yet undiscovered but technically recoverable oil, about one-seventh of the world's undiscovered oil reserves - as well as billions of cubic metres of natural gas, according to a 2008 assessment by the US Geological Survey.

Russia's share of the reserves is at least 41 percent of oil and 70 percent of gas, according to Norwegian officials. But Moscow lacked the deep-drilling technologies and equipment - and that's where ExxonMobil stepped in.

In 2011, Putin oversaw the signing of a ""strategic"" deal between Rosneft and ExxonMobil to develop three oil-and-gas fields in Russia's Arctic - in exchange for shares in six ExxonMobil projects in the United States.

""I'd like to emphasise the exclusiveness of these decisions for Russian companies ... that until today were not able to develop existing deposits in the US,"" Sechin told the Interfax news agency.

Russia: Alexei Ulyukayev arrested over $2m bribe

Tillerson attended the ceremony and said in a statement that the deal ""takes our relationship to a new level and will create substantial value for both companies"". ExxonMobil said it would spend $3.2bn to explore the fields that would give it access to tens of billions of barrels of oil.

The drilling began in 2014 but the deal - along with another joint development in western Siberia - was frozen because of sanctions over Crimea, and ExxonMobil reportedly lost $1bn.

Sechin and Rosneft were blacklisted as part of the sanctions.

Tillerson told ExxonMobil's shareholders ""we always encourage the people who are making those decisions to consider the very broad collateral damage of who are they really harming with sanctions"".

The sanctions did not stop him from visiting Russia at least twice to meet the energy minister and attend an economic forum in St Petersburg, Putin's hometown.

Bright future?

So, the big question now is whether Tillerson will be instrumental in the lifting of sanctions, which will undoubtedly benefit ExxonMobil's current and future operations in Russia.

""He and Donald Trump will initiate the lifting of sanctions with a probability of 70-80 percent,"" analyst Mukhin predicted.

Trump doubts President Barack Obama's claims that Russia meddled in the November presidential vote through hackers and propaganda, and spoke in favour of lifting the sanctions and respecting Russia's interests.

""With him, a certain 'reset' is possible,"" Andrei Kolesnikov of the Carnegie Moscow Centre, a think-tank, told Al Jazeera.

His boss at Carnegie, Dmitri Trenin, said in a tweet that Tillerson's tenure as the fourth-most powerful man in the US would signify ""the greatest discontinuity in US foreign policy since the end of the Cold War""."

Busloads of people were due to begin leaving on Wednesday morning as part of a deal with the government, whose forces have effectively taken control of the entire city after weeks of heavy fighting.

No rebel or civilian had left eastern Aleppo as of 5am (03:00 GMT), according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based monitoring group that relies on a network of sources in the country to monitor the war.

""Save Aleppo. Save humanity.""

The group did not give a reason for the delay of the evacuation. One Syrian rebel official told the Reuters news agency that pro-government Shia militias were obstructing the departure of people from opposition-held districts in a claim that could not be independently verified.

Zouhir Al Shimale, a journalist in east Aleppo, confirmed the delay, adding that the streets were mostly empty in the morning.

""People here are shocked [by the delay],"" he told Al Jazeera. ""We didn't sleep last night waiting to leave.""

Explaining that civilians are fearful that the evacuation could be yet delayed further, Shimale said: ""No one knows what the regime will do.""

Outside the scope of the evacuation agreement, the Russian government said at least 6,000 civilians were evacuated from eastern Aleppo and 366 rebels laid down their weapons and surrendured within the last 24 hours.

Russia's UN ambassador announced late on Tuesday that all military action in east Aleppo had come to a halt and that the Syrian government was in control of the area.

""Over the last hour we have received information that the military activities in east Aleppo have stopped, it has stopped,"" Vitaly Churkin told a heated emergency UN Security Council meeting.

""The Syrian government has established control over east Aleppo.""

Fears have been growing for thousands of trapped civilians as the opposition fighters make a desperate last stand in their remaining pocket of territory in their former stronghold.

""An agreement has been reached for the evacuation of the residents of Aleppo, civilians and fighters with their light weapons, from the besieged districts of east Aleppo,"" Yasser al-Youssef, from the political office of the Nureddin al-Zinki rebel group, told AFP news agency.

He said the deal was ""sponsored by Russia and Turkey"" and would be implemented ""within hours"".

Huseyin Muftuoglu, a Turkish foreign ministry spokesperson, told Al Jazeera that civilians would first be evacuated from Aleppo, followed by rebels.

""They would move towards Idlib, according to the plan,"" he said. ""There is no plan to take them into Turkey.""

Later on Tuesday, Turkey's Deputy Prime Minister Mehmet Simsek announced his government was planning to set up a new tent city to host ""80,000 people fleeing eastern Aleppo"". He did not specify whether the ""tent city"" would be in Turkey or Syria.

News of the deal broke just minutes before the Security Council meeting on Aleppo began at UN headquarters in New York.

When asked by reporters shortly after the meeting if the fall of Aleppo was the end of the peace process, Staffan de Mistura, UN Syria envoy, said it ""should be just the opposite"".

""We should be looking at this as a tragic opportunity to restart the political process.""

The UN earlier said that they received reports about pro-government forces executing scores of civilians in Aleppo, including women and children.

Eighty-two people were reportedly killed when Syrian forces took over rebel-held areas, it said.

Forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad have in some cases entered homes and killed those inside, and in others ""caught and killed on the spot"" fleeing civilians, Rupert Colville, the UN rights office spokesman, said on Tuesday.

""The reports that civilians - including children - are being massacred in cold blood in their homes by Syrian government forces are deeply shocking but not unexpected given their conduct to date. Such extrajudicial executions would amount to war crimes,"" Lynn Maalouf, Deputy Director for Research at Amnesty International's Beirut regional office, said.

'A surrender, not a ceasefire'

Haid Haid, a Syrian researcher and associate fellow at Chatham House, said the evacuation deal was more of ""a surrender, not a ceasefire"".

""This situation will be similar to previous situations: rebels and civilians ... would be allowed out, most likely to rural Aleppo or Idlib, and the Syrian regime will take over the rest of Aleppo,"" he told Al Jazeera.

But with the Syrian government and its allies making steady progress on the battlefield, many were unsure that any deal would take place, Haid said.

""Negotiations have been ongoing for days now, and now the regime is sure that [it] is winning. So unless there is serious pressure from the international community on Russia on the regime, I think this deal might not even happen because they think they're winning ... why allow [the rebels] out if we can kill the rest of them there and now."""

Huseyin Muftuoglu, a Turkish foreign ministry spokesperson, told Al Jazeera that the first civilians would be evacuated from Aleppo, followed by opposition fighters.

Forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad have in some cases entered homes and killed those inside, and in others ""caught and killed on the spot"" fleeing civilians, Rupert Colville, the UN rights office spokesperson, said on Tuesday.

He called the situation ""a complete meltdown of humanity"".

Colville said government forces on Monday killed 82 civilians - including 13 children and 11 women - in the neighbourhoods of Bustan al-Qasr, al-Kalleseh, al-Firdous and al-Salheen - taken over that day by government forces.

Fears have been growing for thousands of trapped civilians as the rebels make a desperate last stand in their remaining pocket of territory in the former opposition stronghold of east Aleppo.

DISPATCH FROM IMTIAZ TYAB, OUR CORRESPONDENT IN GAZIANTEP Some people may be wondering why so many thousands of Syrians chose to remain in what's left of this tiny area that has been so brutally bombarded by the Syrian military and its allies - Iranian-backed militias and Russia. They have for many years now lived in rebel-held territory. Over those years they have been subjected to chemical attacks, gas attacks, starvation tactics, air strikes, barrel bombs - all of this at the hands of the Syrian regime and its allies. Many of them fear that leaving this area will mean certain death for them, and at least according to the UN, for 82 people that's exactly what has happened.

After weeks of heavy fighting, government forces were poised on Tuesday to take full control of Aleppo, dealing the biggest blow to Syria's rebellion in more than five years of civil war.

The Syrian army said on Tuesday evening it could declare full control over east Aleppo ""at any moment"" as it advanced against rebels holed up in just a handful of neighbourhoods.

About 80,000 civilians are now trapped in the few square miles of east Aleppo that remain under opposition control.

In an alarming statement made on Tuesday, UNICEF said that nearly 100 unaccompanied children were trapped in a building under heavy attack in east Aleppo, citing an unnamed doctor in the city.

""According to alarming reports from a doctor in the city, many children, possibly more than 100, unaccompanied or separated from their families, are trapped in a building under heavy attack in east Aleppo,"" said Geert Cappelaere, UNICEF regional director.

Scenes of carnage

Witnesses described scenes of carnage in previously opposition-held areas, with bodies lying amid the rubble of eastern Aleppo's streets as desperate residents sat on pavements with nowhere to shelter.

""Our fate is sealed. Why would we hide? It won't do us any good. We will either die or be captured,"" said Ibrahim Abu al-Laith, a spokesman for the White Helmets rescue service.

Jan Egeland, UN special adviser for Syria, said the past 24 hours had been the most dramatic so far in ""the bloody, bitter, horrific battle for Aleppo"".

He gave warning that those responsible would be held accountable for the bloodshed.

Lina al-Shami, an architect and well-known social media activist based in Aleppo, says dozens of people are trapped in the rubble and that civil defence forces can do nothing to extract them.

""I know I may die or get arrested by this criminal regime, but I have to let the world know what is happening here in Aleppo,"" she told Al Jazeera by Skype on Tuesday.

""We are facing genocide. There are people lying injured in the streets, still alive under the wreckage, and civil defence can't do anything to help them.""

Lina al-Shami, an architect and activist in east Aleppo, speaks to Al Jazeera





Citizens and social media activists across Aleppo's remaining opposition-held districts sent out ""last messages"" on social media late on Monday night as the bombing intensified and government forces continued to advance.

""Don't believe any more in United Nations ... don't believe any more in the international community. They are satisfied that we are being killed, that we are facing ... the most horrible massacre in [recent] history,"" said Abdulkafi al-Hamdo, a well-known social media activist in east Aleppo.

Zeid Ra'ad al Hussein, the UN human rights chief, appealed on Tuesday to the international community to demand that Syria allow monitoring of its treatment of people fleeing eastern Aleppo.

He gave warning that populations of other opposition-held towns could face the same fate.

""The crushing of Aleppo, the immeasurably terrifying toll on its people, the bloodshed, the wanton slaughter of men, women and children, the destruction - and we are nowhere near the end of this cruel conflict,"" Zeid said in a statement.

""What is happening with Aleppo could repeat itself in Douma, in Raqqa, in Idlib. We cannot let this continue.""

All-out offensive

Syria's army said it had taken 98 percent of the territory once held by opposition fighters in east Aleppo, after launching an all-out offensive last month to seize control of the entire city.

Scores of men who fled from the city's east to the west have been detained by the Syrian authorities and forced into military conscription, reports say.

The government assault has been backed by heavy artillery fire and air strikes, with at least 463 civilians, including 62 children, killed in eastern Aleppo since mid-November, according to the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR).

Another 130 people, including 40 children, have been killed in the city's western districts by opposition rocket fire.

Diplomatic efforts to end the conflict have repeatedly failed, with the latest talks between Russia and the US on a ceasefire to allow the evacuation of civilians making no breakthrough.

Russia, a crucial Assad ally, launched an air war in support of his forces last year, while the US and other Western nations backed the opposition.

Turkey, which has also supported opposition forces in Syria, said on Tuesday it would intensify talks with Russia on a ceasefire.

""Today, tomorrow, every day, we will intensify our talks with Russia and other countries so we can find a solution to this humanitarian tragedy,"" Mevlut Cavusoglu, the Turkish foreign minister, said.

""Our efforts continue in particular for civilians to be able to leave and for a ceasefire.""

The UN estimates that nearly 400,000 people have been killed since the Syrian conflict began in March 2011, and more than half the population has been displaced.

""While stressing that the United Nations is not able to independently verify these reports, the secretary-general is conveying his grave concern to the relevant parties.""

Activists in Aleppo have reported summary executions as pro-government forces enter districts once under control of the opposition.

The UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights says at least 60 opposition members have been killed.

""The opposition is describing the situation in besieged areas as catastrophic,"" Al Jazeera's Zeina Khodr, reporting from Antakya in southern Turkey, said.

""They are issuing an urgent appeal to evacuate civilians who are trapped in besieged areas,"" she said. ""Tens of thousands of people are believed to be in a very small pocket of territory coming under intense bombardment.

""There have been desperate messages from people trapped inside asking, 'Where is humanity?', 'Where is the world?', 'Why is nobody helping us?'""

The fall of Aleppo would be the biggest rebel defeat since Syria's conflict began in 2011, and leave the government in control of the country's five major cities.

Government victory imminent

Al Jazeera's Zeina Khodr reports from Antakya: ""The rebels in Aleppo have all but declared defeat. We understand that there is no agreement for any evacuation plan. The United States says negotiations in Geneva reached an impasse; Russia says it reached a dead end. Our sources in the Free Syrian Army say Russia is demanding the rebels surrender, hand themselves over to pro-government forces - that would be the condition for a ceasefire and to create a safe corridor for civilians to leave... Opposition activists, citizen journalists, and White Helmet volunteers are also there [in opposition-held areas of Aleppo] and according to the government, engaging in treason. They fear for their safety - for their lives - if they are caught by government forces.""

According to the AFP news agency, a Syrian military official in Aleppo said late on Monday: ""We're living the final moments before victory.""

""The operation in eastern neighbourhoods is entering its final phase,"" he said earlier, as fierce clashes were reported in the few districts still under rebel control.

The pro-government TV network Alikbariyah Syria broadcast footage of celebrations in the streets of west Aleppo, as people handed out chocolates and congratulated each other on ""the victory"".

""The joy of the people and the army are one,"" said one driver, wearing military fatigues.

In the Mashhad neighbourhood, residents fleeing the army advance crowded the streets earlier on Monday, AFP quoted witnesses as saying.

Displaced civilians - many hungry after fleeing without food - sat on pavements or lay on the street with nowhere else to go, they said.

The Syrian Observatory said on Monday that another 10,000 people had fled rebel areas in the previous 24 hours, bringing the total number of those who have left - mostly to government-held territory - to 130,000.

The Russian defence ministry also said that since the start of the Aleppo battle, more than 2,200 rebels had surrendered and 100,000 civilians had left areas of the city that were controlled by the opposition.

""The battle of Aleppo has reached its end. It is just a matter of a small period of time ... it's a total collapse,"" said the director of the Syrian Observatory, Rami Abdul Rahman.

But while Aleppo's fall would deal a stunning blow to opposition fighters trying to remove Assad from power, he would still be far from restoring control across Syria.

Swaths of the country remain in rebel hands, while the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant group (ISIL, also known as ISIS) reportedly retook the ancient city of Palmyra on Sunday."

The fighters withdrew from at least six more east Aleppo neighbourhoods on Monday in the face of government advances, including al-Salheen, al-Firdous and Bustan al-Qasr, once one of the most fortified districts under opposition control.

Residents told Al Jazeera that government forces summarily executed dozens of civilians over alleged connections to opposition fighters. The figure could not be independently verified by Al Jazeera.

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said at least 60 people were killed by gunfire or shelling on Monday as government forces pushed into Aleppo's remaining opposition-held districts.

Earlier in the day, Lieutenant-General Zaid al-Saleh, head of the Aleppo security committee, announced in the recently recaptured neighbourhood of Sheikh Saeed that the government push to retake the entire city was in its final stages.

""The battle in east Aleppo should end quickly. They [opposition fighters] don't have much time. They either have to surrender or die,"" he said.

President Bashar al-Assad's government's takeover of the entire city would mark its greatest victory since the war began in 2011.

Dire conditions

Opposition fighters and tens of thousands of civilians are now confined to just a handful of neighbourhoods in the city's southeast, including the Sukkari and Mashhad districts.

Salim Abu al-Nassar, a dentist from Bustan al-Qasr in east Aleppo, put out a video appeal on social media after fleeing to al-Ansari neighbourhood, calling for a ceasefire and describing the dire conditions in the small portion of the city left in opposition control.

""Within eight kilometres square, we have over 80,000 human beings ... everyone is piled on top of each other ... This area may witness a real massacre if [the army] decides to move here,"" he said.

""This may be my last call. I hope someone will listen somewhere around the world and relate that to their government so they can stop the shelling, the war, this madness. We hope to live. We love life. I hope we can meet again.""

Lina al-Shami, an architect and well-known social media activist from east Aleppo, also put out a ""last message"" on Twitter.

Syria's state TV said on Sunday that more than 70,000 of eastern Aleppo's estimated 275,000 residents had fled in recent days, mostly to government-held western Aleppo districts.

Scores of men who fled from the east to the west have been detained by the Syrian authorities and forced into military conscription, reports say.

Russia's defence ministry said on Monday that 728 Syrian fighters had laid down their weapons over the past 24 hours and relocated to western Aleppo.

The Russia-backed ground offensive, which began on November 26, followed an intensive aerial bombing campaign that knocked out most of the medical facilities, targeted civil defence and municipal vehicles and blocked roads with rubble.

The eastern Aleppo area has also been cut off from outside assistance since July by a government siege.

Opposition fighters captured the eastern half of Aleppo, Syria's largest city and former commercial capital, in 2012.

Delayed ceasefire

The US state department said on Monday that Russia told the US it wanted a ceasefire in east Aleppo delayed for several days, a proposal the agency said was unacceptable in view of the continued attacks on civilians.

""Rather than accepting the US proposal for an immediate cessation, the Russians informed us that a cessation could not start for several days, meaning that the assault by the regime and its supporters will continue until any agreement will go into effect,"" John Kirby, state department spokesman, said in response to a question about weekend talks in Geneva.

""Given the dire situation in Aleppo and the reports of continued attacks on civilians and infrastructure, this was just simply not acceptable.""

Kirby said US and Russian officials were continuing their talks in the Swiss city, although there was for now an unbridgeable gap between their positions.

""Our teams are still trying to work this out,"" he said. ""While we would still like to get there ... I think we're certainly at an impasse right now.""

Aisha, a mother of three children, is one of them.

Last week, she and her family fled farther south in Aleppo when government forces took over her neighbourhood. Despite the bombings, weak utilities and sanitation, and depleting food supply, Aisha says she prefers to live in rebel areas.

""We're hearing about the army taking and arresting people, so I'm content to wait for a route to open so I can go to live with my family in the countryside,"" she said. On Friday, hundreds of men from Aleppo went missing after entering government territory, including some of Aisha's family members with whom she lost contact.

After the military onslaught that began three weeks ago, the Syrian army is now controlling around 85 percent of previously rebel-held parts of east Aleppo. The UN and rebel sources say 100,000 people are now in east Aleppo, crammed into a handful of neighbourhoods that amount to around 15 percent of the area the rebels held three weeks ago.

Civilians still trapped in rebel-controlled parts of the city say they are facing immense hardships, especially those who recently fled the army's advance. ""We don't know how to sleep or eat. I don't have anything with me, just a little money,"" said Aisha, who claims to have walked to her current location.

""We went from street to street and the sound of bullets doesn't stop. There was no one else but us on the street.""

The fear of violence keeps Aisha and others from leaving east Aleppo altogether. ""I can't risk something happening to my children by leaving. There's bombing happening … throughout the day and night,"" said Aisha, referring to Syrian army air strikes.

The UN also said it heard reports of rebel groups preventing some civilians from leaving for government areas.

According to Ismail Abdullah of the Syrian Civil Defence - aka the White Helmets - the residents who remain in the city are civilians and fighters. ""Most of them are families, and women and children. A lot of them are families of fighters, and the Free Syrian Army. And there are families of the opposition,"" said Abdullah.

Abdullah, whose group performs search-and-rescue missions in the city, says space is running out for those in the area. ""There's no place for people to live. Many of the people are in sub-par housing … with no doors or windows,"" he said.

And the situation appears to be getting worse for them. In addition to food shortages, reliance on limited gas for power, and intense fighting, the medical situation remains grave.

According to Doctors Without Borders (MSF), medical supplies are running extremely low in east Aleppo, and hospitals have been severely damaged from air strikes.

First responders such as Abdullah face hardships, too. ""Most ambulances are also damaged or out of service and roads are totally blocked with rubble from the destruction, making movement very difficult for first responders, and putting at risk the severely wounded who often cannot access emergency care on time,"" said Evita Mouawad, an adviser for MSF in neighbouring Jordan.

Meanwhile, rebels in Aleppo continue to fight on, despite what appears to be an imminent government victory. ""We cannot do anything to protect the civilians in the city. The regime has all kinds of weapons,"" said Ahmad Jalal, a fighter in one of the armed groups.

""We all face the same fate. Every place in east Aleppo faces bombing and there's no safe place at all."""

""The issue of withdrawing militants is the subject of separate agreements. This agreement has not yet been reached, largely because the United States insists on unacceptable terms,"" Sergei Ryabkov was quoted as saying by the RIA news agency on Sunday.

Ryabkov said talks between Russian and US experts would continue in Geneva, RIA reported.

""What Western agencies are reporting does not necessarily correspond with reality,"" Ryabkov said. He however, added that Russia was working to create the necessary conditions for the safe passage of people from Aleppo.

Rebel officials told Reuters earlier on Sunday that a proposal had been put forth for fighters to leave the embattled city with their families and other civilians.

Russia and the US have been meeting in Geneva to seek a solution to the fighting and the humanitarian crisis it has caused.

Syrian regime forces, aided by Russian aerial onslaught, have taken more than 80 percent of rebel-held eastern Aleppo, and thousands of civilians are trapped in the warzone without enough water and other basic amenities.

""The fall of Aleppo or any other city or town doesn't mean the end of the revolution. The revolution doesn't end in a city or a town ... It is an ideology and ideology will never die,"" Ahmed Mohammad, a Syrian activist, told Al Jazeera.

Also on Sunday, Syria's state news agency said at least 4,000 people fled the opposition-held enclave of Aleppo, some getting on government buses.

Elsewhere in Syria, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL, also known as ISIS) recaptured the ancient city of Palmyra after thousands of its fighters launched a multi-pronged assault, according to reports.

Symbolic attack

Syria's state TV said more than 70,000 of eastern Aleppo's estimated 275,000 residents have fled in recent days, mostly to government-held western Aleppo districts.

Fighters still control about 7sq km in the city's east, down from the original 45sq km they once held, according to state TV.

Residents said government air strikes hit the last remaining bridge that linked eastern and western Aleppo, a largely symbolic attack.

They also reported that government and allied troops kept up their bombing of a handful of neighbourhoods, which have become the shelter for most of the civilians who chose to remain.

The Russia-backed ground offensive, which began on November 26, followed an intensive aerial bombing campaign that knocked out most of the medical facilities, targeted civil defence and municipal vehicles and blocked roads with rubble.

The eastern Aleppo area has also been cut off from outside assistance since July by a government siege.

Fighters captured the eastern half of Aleppo, Syria's largest city and former commercial capital, in 2012.

The government's recapture of the city would mark its greatest victory since the war began in 2011."

The Russian Monitoring Centre in Syria said on Sunday that ISIL, or the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant group, had drawn on ""significant forces"" from its strongholds in nearby Raqqa and Deir Az-zor, with more than 4,000 fighters, backed by tanks, attacking the city.

Russia, Syria's ally, had launched a flurry of air strikes overnight that reportedly killed 300 ISIL fighters and forced the group to retreat.

However, later on Sunday, ISIL, also known as ISIS, claimed to be in full control of Palmyra via Amaq, a news agency that supports the group, with government troops forced to retreat to the south of the city.

Talal al-Barazi, the governor of Homs, confirmed to Syrian state TV that ISIL had captured Palmyra, adding that the army was using all of its means to regain control.

ISIL captured Palmyra, also known as Tadmur, in May last year, before losing the city 10 months later to much international fanfare.

During that time, it destroyed some ancient sites and artefacts while using others to stage mass executions.

String of defeats

ISIL also destroyed the infamous Tadmur prison, where thousands of government opponents were reported to have been tortured.

ISIL has suffered a string of defeats in both Syria and Iraq in recent months, losing several towns and cities it had captured in 2014.

According to defence analysts at the think tank IHS Jane, ISIL lost about 12 percent of its territory in 2016, and about 14 percent in 2015."
